The scoring system comprised 14 histological features, 4 of which were evaluated semi-quantitatively: steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-2), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2), and fibrosis (0-4). Another nine features were recorded as present or absent. An anonymized study set of 50 cases (32 from adult hepatology services, 18 from pediatric hepatology services) was assembled, coded, and circulated. For the validation study, agreement on scoring and a diagnostic categorization (\"NASH,\" \"borderline,\" or \"not NASH\") were evaluated by using weighted kappa statistics. Inter-rater agreement on adult cases was: 0.84 for fibrosis, 0.79 for steatosis, 0.56 for injury, and 0.45 for lobular inflammation. Agreement on diagnostic category was 0.61. Using multiple logistic regression, five features were independently associated with the diagnosis of NASH in adult biopsies: steatosis (P = .009), hepatocellular ballooning (P = .0001), lobular inflammation (P = .0001), fibrosis (P = .0001), and the absence of lipogranulomas (P = .001). The proposed NAS is the unweighted sum of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning scores. In conclusion, we present a strong scoring system and NAS for NAFLD and NASH with reasonable inter-rater reproducibility that should be useful for studies of both adults and children with any degree of NAFLD. NAS of ≥5 correlated with a diagnosis of NASH, and biopsies with scores of less than 3 were diagnosed as \"not NASH.\" Copyright © 2005 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</td>\n",

       "      <td>OBJECTIVE: Steatohepatitis is a morphological pattern of liver injury that may be seen in alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. This pattern may occur with obesity, diabetes, the use of certain drugs, or the cause may be idiopathic. The well-recognized histopathological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) include hepatocellular steatosis and ballooning, mixed acute and chronic lobular inflammation, and zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis. Currently, there are no systems for grading necroinflammatory activity or for staging fibrosis as exist for various other forms of chronic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to develop such a grading and staging system and was based on review of liver biopsies from 51 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center. METHODS: For determination of grade, 10 histological variables of activity were initially analyzed; an overall impression of mild, moderate, and severe was made and the variables considered to be most significant were used to develop the necroinflammatory grade. RESULTS: The histological lesions considered to be significant were: steatosis, ballooning, and intra-acinar and portal inflammation. A staging score was developed to reflect both location and extent of fibrosis. The fibrosis score was derived from the extent of zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis with possible additional portal/periportal fibrosis and architectural remodeling. Fibrosis stages are as follows: Stage 1, zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis; Stage 2, as above with portal fibrosis; Stage 3, as above with bridging fibrosis; and Stage 4, cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: We propose a grading and staging system that reflects the unique histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with the insulin-resistance syndrome, at present defined as the metabolic syndrome, whose limits were recently set. We assessed the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 304 consecutive NAFLD patients without overt diabetes, on the basis of 3 or more criteria out of 5 defined by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (waist circumference, glucose, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, triglycerides, and arterial pressure). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased with increasing body mass index, from 18% in normal-weight subjects to 67% in obesity. Insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment method) was significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2; P &lt; .001). Liver biopsy was available in 163 cases (54%). A total of 120 patients (73.6%) were classified as having nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); 88% of them had a metabolic syndrome (vs. 53% of patients with pure fatty liver; P &lt; .0001). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the presence of metabolic syndrome carried a high risk of NASH among NAFLD subjects (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2-8.9; P = .026) after correction for sex, age, and body mass. In particular, the syndrome was associated with a high risk of severe fibrosis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-11.2; P = .032). In conclusion, the presence of multiple metabolic disorders is associated with a potentially progressive, severe liver disease. The increasing prevalence of obesity, coupled with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and ultimately the metabolic syndrome puts a very large population at risk of forthcoming liver failure in the next decades.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fatty liver disease that develops in the absence of alcohol abuse is recognized increasingly as a major health burden. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions at a Single Topic Conference held September 20-22, 2002, and sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The conference focused on fatty liver disorders. Estimates based on imaging and autopsy studies suggest that about 20% to 30% of adults in the United States and other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the liver. About 10% of these individuals, or fully 2% to 3% of adults, are estimated to meet current diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained liver injury leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in a fraction, possibly up to one third, of those with NASH, and NASH may be a cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. NASH is now a significant health issue for obese children as well, leading to cirrhosis in some. The diagnostic criteria for NASH continue to evolve and rely on the histologic findings of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning, Mallory bodies), and the pattern of fibrosis. Generally recognized indications for biopsy include establishing the diagnosis and staging of the injury, but strict guidelines do not exist. Liver enzymes are insensitive and cannot be used reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Older age, obesity, and diabetes are predictive of fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is multifactorial. Insulin resistance may be an important factor in the accumulation of hepatocellular fat, whereas excess intracellular fatty acids, oxidant stress, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver. Efforts are underway to refine the role of insulin resistance in NASH and determine whether improving insulin sensitivity pharmacologically is an effective treatment. An altered lifestyle may be a more effective means of improving insulin sensitivity. The research agenda for the future includes establishing the role of insulin resistance and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in NASH, determining the pathogenesis of cellular injury, defining predisposing genetic abnormalities, identifying better noninvasive predictors of disease, and defining effective therapy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the lynchpin between steatosis and cirrhosis in the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disorders (NAFLD), was barely recognized in 1981. NAFLD is now present in 17% to 33% of Americans, has a worldwide distribution, and parallels the frequency of central adiposity, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NASH could be present in one third of NAFLD cases. Age, activity of steatohepatitis, and established fibrosis predispose to cirrhosis, which has a 7- to 10-year liver-related mortality of 12% to 25%. Many cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis are likely endstage NASH. While endstage NAFLD currently accounts for 4% to 10% of liver transplants, this may soon rise. Pathogenic concepts for NAFLD/NASH must account for the strong links with overnutrition and underactivity, insulin resistance, and genetic factors. Lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, cytokines, and other proinflammatory mediators may each play a role in transition of steatosis to NASH. The present \"gold standard\" management of NASH is modest weight reduction, particularly correction of central obesity achieved by combining dietary measures with increased physical activity. Whether achieved by \"lifestyle adjustment\" or anti-obesity surgery, this improves insulin resistance and reverses steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. The same potential for \"unwinding\" fibrotic NASH is indicated by studies of the peroxisome proliferation activator receptor (PPAR)-γ agonist \"glitazones,\" but these agents may improve liver disease at the expense of worsening obesity. Future challenges are to approach NAFLD as a preventive public health initiative and to motivate affected persons to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

       "      <td>Background and Aims: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that NASH is associated with 2 defects: (1) peripheral insulin resistance, which increases lipolysis, delivery of free fatty acids (FFA) to the liver, and hepatic fatty acid β oxidation, thereby creating oxidative stress; and (2) an abnormality within the hepatocytes that might render them more susceptible to injury from oxidative stress. Methods: The hypothesis was tested by evaluation of (1) insulin resistance by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic (10 and 40 mU · m-2 · min-1) euglycemic clamp; (2) insulin effects on lipolysis by enrichment of [U-13C]glycerol; (3) frequency and severity of structural defects in hepatocyte mitochondria in vivo; (4) fatty acid β oxidation from serum [β-OH butyrate], release of water-soluble radioactivity from 3H-palmitate by cultured fibroblasts and urinary dicarboxylic acid excretion; and (5) hepatic lipid peroxidation by immunohistochemical staining for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Subjects with NASH (n = 6-10 for different studies) were compared with those with fatty liver (n = 6) or normal controls (n = 6). Results: NASH and fatty liver were both associated with insulin resistance, with mean glucose infusion rates (normal/fatty liver/NASH) of step 1, 4.5/1.6/0.9; step 2, 9.5/7.7/4.5 (P &amp;lt; 0.03 for both steps). Although baseline rates of glycerol appearance were higher in those with NASH than in those with fatty liver (means, 14.6 vs. 21.6 μmol · kg-1 · min-1; P &amp;lt; 0.05), neither group significantly suppressed glycerol appearance at insulin infusion rates of 10 mU · m-2 · min-1. NASH was associated with loss of mitochondrial cristae and paracrystalline inclusions in 9 of 10 subjects, compared with 0 of 6 subjects with fatty liver. However, no evidence of a generalized defect in fatty acid β oxidation was noted in any group. Also, mean [β-OH butyrate] was highest in those with NASH (means, 90 vs. 110 vs. 160 μmol/L; P &amp;lt; 0.04). Increased staining for 3-NT was present in fatty liver, and even greater staining was seen in NASH. Conclusions: These data indicate that peripheral insulin resistance, increased fatty acid β oxidation, and hepatic oxidative stress are present in both fatty liver and NASH, but NASH alone is associated with mitochondrial structural defects. © 2001 American Gastroenterological Association.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes in patients of developed countries. We determined the long-term clinical and histological courses of such patients. In a cohort study, 129 consecutively enrolled patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven NAFLD were reevaluated. Survival and causes of death were compared with a matched reference population. Living NAFLD patients were offered repeat liver biopsy and clinical and biochemical investigation. Mean follow-up (SD) was 13.7 (1.3) years. Mortality was not increased in patients with steatosis. Survival of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was reduced (P = .01). These subjects more often died from cardiovascular (P = .04) and liver-related (P = .04) causes. Seven patients (5.4%) developed end-stage liver disease, including 3 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The absence of periportal fibrosis at baseline had a negative predictive value of 100% in predicting liver-related complications. At follow-up, 69 of 88 patients had diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Progression of liver fibrosis occurred in 41%. These subjects more often had a weight gain exceeding 5 kg (P = .02), they were more insulin resistant (P = .04), and they exhibited more pronounced hepatic fatty infiltration (P = .03) at follow-up. In conclusion, NAFLD with elevated liver enzymes is associated with a clinically significant risk of developing end-stage liver disease. Survival is lower in patients with NASH. Most NAFLD patients will develop diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the long term. Progression of liver fibrosis is associated with more pronounced insulin resistance and significant weight gain. Copyright © 2006 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may present with increased hepatic fibrosis progressing to end-stage liver disease. No factors that determine increasing fibrosis and histologically advanced disease have been recognized, thus, liver biopsy is recommended in all patients for diagnosis and prognosis. Our aim was to identify independent predictors of severe hepatic fibrosis in patients with NASH. One hundred and forty-four patients were studied. All patients underwent liver biopsy. Clinical and biochemical variables were examined with univariate and multivariate analysis. Thirty- seven (26%) patients had no abnormal fibrosis, 53 (37%) had mild fibrosis, 15 (10%) had moderate fibrosis, 14 (10%) had bridging fibrosis, and 25 (17%) had cirrhosis. In multivariate analysis, older age (P = .001), obesity (P = .002), diabetes mellitus (P = .009), and aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio greater than 1 (P = .03) were significant predictors of severe liver fibrosis (bridging/cirrhosis). Body mass index (P = .003) was the only independent predictor of the degree of fat infiltration. Increased transferrin saturation correlated positively with the severity of fibrosis (P = .02) in univariate analysis, and there was a trend for more female patients among those with more advanced fibrosis (P = .09). However, iron studies or gender were not significant when controlled for age, obesity, diabetes, and AST/ALT ratio. In conclusion, older age, obesity, and presence of diabetes mellitus help identify those NASH patients who might have severe liver fibrosis. This is the subgroup of patients with NASH who would be expected to derive the most benefit from having a liver biopsy and considering investigational therapies.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease, and its worldwide prevalence continues to increase with the growing obesity epidemic. This study assesses the epidemiology of NAFLD in adults based on clinical literature published over the past 30 years. Aim To review epidemiology and natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in adults based on clinical literature published over the past 30 years. Methods An in-depth search of PubMed (1980-2010) was based on five search terms: 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease' OR 'non-alcoholic steatohepatitis' OR 'fatty liver' OR 'steatosis' AND 'incidence' [MeSH Terms] OR 'prevalence' [MeSH Terms] OR 'natural history'. Studies of paediatric cohorts were excluded. Articles were categorised by topic and summarised, noting generalisations concerning their content. Results Four study categories included NAFLD incidence, prevalence, risk factors and natural history. Studies related to NAFLD prevalence and incidence indicate that the diagnosis is heterogeneous and relies on a variety of assessment tools, including liver biopsy, radiological tests such as ultrasonography, and blood testing such as liver enzymes. The prevalence of NAFLD is highest in populations with pre-existing metabolic conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes. Many studies investigating the natural history of NAFLD verify the progression from NASH to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes. Within the NAFLD spectrum, only NASH progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the growing epidemic of obesity, the prevalence and impact of NAFLD continues to increase, making NASH potentially the most common cause of advanced liver disease in coming decades. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background &amp; Aims: This prospective study evaluates the role of radiological modalities in establishing the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: Consecutive patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were enrolled (2000-2001). Patients with other liver diseases and significant alcohol consumption (&gt;20 g/day) were excluded. Clinicodemographic data were gathered at the time of liver biopsy. Each biopsy specimen was assessed by a hepatopathologist. Each patient underwent a limited abdominal ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Films were interpreted by a radiologist who used a predetermined radiological protocol. Each radiological study was reread by the same radiologist and a second radiologist. Results: Patients with NASH had greater aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.03), greater ferritin levels (P = 0.05), more hepatocyte ballooning (P &lt; 0.0001), and more fibrosis (P = 0.002). None of the radiological features distinguished between NASH and other types of NAFLD. No radiological modality detected the presence of hepatocyte ballooning, Mallory's hyaline, or fibrosis, which are important features in the diagnosis of NASH. The presence of &gt;33% fat on liver biopsy was optimal for detecting steatosis on radiological imaging. Conclusions: Differences between NASH and nonprogressive NAFLD were not apparent with any radiological modality. Of the pathologic features important for establishing the diagnosis of NASH, only the severity of steatosis was reflected in these radiological modalities. Good intraobserver agreement was evident for each modality (US, CT, and MRI) that was superior to interobserver agreement.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background &amp; Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis; whether NASH plays also a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Methods: Among 641 cirrhosis-associated HCCs, we retrospectively identified 44 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC). Of these, 23 were actively followed up and were compared in a case-control study with viral- and alcohol-associated HCC. Family and personal history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, obesity, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Iron status and presence of mutations in the HFE gene of familiar hemochromatosis were also determined. Results: Family history was not different in relation to etiology. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes was significantly higher in patients with CC. Although liver function was similar, CC patients had higher glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride plasma levels, increased parameters of insulin resistance, and lower aminotransferase levels. Iron status and prevalence of mutations in the HFE gene did not differ. Logistic regression analysis identified in sequence hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, and normal aminotransferases as independent factors associated with HCC arising in CC. Conclusions: Features suggestive of NASH are more frequently observed in HCC arising in patients with CC than in age- and sex-matched HCC patients of well-defined viral or alcoholic etiology. HCC may represent a late complication of NASH-related cirrhosis.</td>\n",

Results: Twenty-six patients (25%) were found to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 11 (42%) of these had advanced fibrosis. A raised index of insulin resistance (odds ratio [OR] 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-26), systemic hypertension (OR 5.2, 95% Cl 2.0-13.5), and raised alanine aminotransferase (OR 8.6, 95% Cl 3.1-23.5) were independent predictors of NASH. A combination of 2 or 3 of these predictors allows a sensitivity of 0.8 and specificity of 0.89 for NASH. Alcohol consumption was associated with a reduction in NASH (OR 0.35, 95% Cl 0.12-1.00) and diabetes (OR 0.18, 95% Cl 0.047-0.67). Conclusion: Insulin resistance and systemic hypertension, features of the metabolic syndrome, are independently associated with advanced forms of NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption seems to reduce the risk of NAFLD in the severely obese, possibly by reducing insulin resistance.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background &amp; Aims: In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the distinction between steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) and the assessment of the severity of the disease rely on liver histology alone. The aim of this study was to assess the sampling error of liver biopsy and its impact on the diagnosis and staging of NASH. Methods: Fifty-one patients with NAFLD underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with 2 samples collected. The agreement between paired biopsy specimens was assessed by the percentage of discordant results and by the κ reliability test. Results: No features displayed high agreement; substantial agreement was only seen for steatosis grade; moderate agreement for hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis; fair agreement for Mallory bodies; acidophilic bodies and lobular inflammation displayed only slight agreement. Overall, the discordance rate for the presence of hepatocyte ballooning was 18%, and ballooning would have been missed in 24% of patients had only 1 biopsy been performed. The negative predictive value of a single biopsy for the diagnosis of NASH was at best 0.74. Discordance of 1 stage or more was 41%. Six of 17 patients with bridging fibrosis (35%) on 1 sample had only mild or no fibrosis on the other and therefore could have been under staged with only 1 biopsy. Intraobserver variability was systematically lower than sampling variability and therefore could not account for most of the sampling error. Conclusions: Histologic lesions of NASH are unevenly distributed throughout the liver parenchyma; therefore, sampling error of liver biopsy can result in substantial misdiagnosis and staging inaccuracies. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency- associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

The purpose of this study was to prospectively define the prevalence of both NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: Outpatients 18 to 70 years old were recruited from Brooke Army Medical Center. All patients completed a baseline questionnaire and ultrasound. If fatty liver was identified, then laboratory data and a liver biopsy were obtained. Results: Four hundred patients were enrolled. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients completed the questionnaire and ultrasound. Mean age (range, 28-70 years) was 54.6 years (7.35); 62.5% Caucasian, 22% Hispanic, and 11.3% African American; 50.9% female; mean body mass index (BMI) (calculated as kg/m2) was 29.8 (5.64); and diabetes and hypertension prevalence 16.5% and 49.7%, respectively. Prevalence of NAFLD was 46%. NASH was confirmed in 40 patients (12.2% of total cohort, 29.9% of ultrasound positive patients). Hispanics had the highest prevalence of NAFLD (58.3%), then Caucasians (44.4%) and African Americans (35.1%). NAFLD patients were more likely to be male (58.9%), older (P = .004), hypertensive (P &amp;lt; .00005), and diabetic (P &amp;lt; .00005). They had a higher BMI (P &amp;lt; .0005), ate fast food more often (P = .049), and exercised less (P = 0.02) than their non-NAFLD counterparts. Hispanics had a higher prevalence of NASH compared with Caucasians (19.4% vs 9.8%; P = .03). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, BMI, insulin, Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index, and cytokeratin-18 correlated with NASH. Among the 54 diabetic patients, NAFLD was found in 74% and NASH in 22.2%. Conclusion: Prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is higher than estimated previously.

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is often linked with disorders that are clearly associated with insulin resistance (IR): obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia. We tested the hypotheses that (1) IR is an essential requirement for the development of NASH and (2) a high association between IR and liver disease is relatively specific for NASH. We measured body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, and fasting serum lipid, insulin, C-peptide, and glucose levels in 66 patients with NASH (21 with advanced fibrosis and 45 with mild fibrosis). IR was determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). We also determined the strength of the association of NASH with insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) as defined by World Health Organization criteria. To assess whether the finding of IR was relatively specific to NASH rather than simply to obesity or liver disease, we compared the results of a subset of 36 patients with less-severe NASH with 36 age- and sex-matched patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) of comparable fibrotic severity. IR was confirmed in 65 patients (98%) with NASH, and 55 (87%) fulfilled minimum criteria for IRS. IR was found in lean as well as in overweight and obese patients. The IR values and the prevalence of IRS (75% vs. 8.3%) were significantly higher in those with NASH than in comparable cases of HCV. Hyperinsulinemia was attributable to increased insulin secretion rather than decreased hepatic extraction. In conclusion, most patients with NASH have IRS, and there is a near-universal association between NASH and IR irrespective of obesity. IR is present in mild as well as advanced cases of NASH but is unusual in chronic HCV of similar fibrotic severity.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This review addresses recent advances in specific mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Because of its unique metabolism and relationship to the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is an important target of the toxicity of drugs, xenobiotics, and oxidative stress. In cholestatic disease, endogenously generated bile acids produce hepatocellular apoptosis by stimulating Fas translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where self-aggregation occurs to trigger apoptosis. Kupffer cell activation and neutrophil infiltration extend toxic injury. Kupffer cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, and chemokines, which induce neutrophil extravasation and activation. The liver expresses many cytochrome P450 isoforms, including ethanol-induced CYP2E1. CYP2E1 generates ROS, activates many toxicologically important substrates, and may be the central pathway by which ethanol causes oxidative stress. In acetaminophen toxicity, nitric oxide (NO) scavenges superoxide to produce peroxynitrite, which then causes protein nitration and tissue injury. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, nitration is prevented, but unscavenged superoxide production then causes toxic lipid peroxidation to occur instead. Microvesicular steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cytolytic hepatitis involve mitochondrial dysfunction, including impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and damage to mitochondrial DNA. Induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is another mechanism causing mitochondrial failure, which can lead to necrosis from ATP depletion or caspase-dependent apoptosis if ATP depletion does not occur fully. Because of such diverse mechanisms, hepatotoxicity remains a major reason for drug withdrawal from pharmaceutical development and clinical use.</td>\n",

       "      <td>We characterized 70 consecutive patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis to assess major risks for liver disease. Each patient was reevaluated for past alcohol exposure, scored by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis (IAH) score and assessed for viral hepatitis risks and risks for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The results were compared with 50 consecutive NASH patients, 39 nonalcoholic patients age 50 and over with cirrhosis from hepatitis C, and 33 consecutive patients with cirrhosis caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Among the cryptogenic group, 49 (70%) were female, and the mean age was 63 ± 11 years. Although ascites and variceal bleeding were common, almost one half lacked major signs of complicated portal hypertension. A history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or obesity was present in 51 (73%). Nineteen (27%) patients had a history of blood transfusions antedating the diagnosis of cirrhosis. No clinical or histological features distinguished this group from the other patients, and 14 (74%) of these had a history of obesity and/or diabetes. Nineteen of the remaining nontransfused patients had indeterminant IAH scores but were histologically and biochemically indistinguishable from the others. Twelve of these (63%) also had a history of obesity and/or diabetes. Both diabetes and obesity were significantly more common in the cryptogenic cirrhotic patients compared with the cirrhotic patients with PBC or hepatitis C. In contrast, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes was similar to the NASH patients who were, on average, a decade younger. Although there is some diversity that indicates more than one cause, our findings suggest that NASH plays an under- recognized role in many patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, most of whom are older, type 2 diabetic and obese females.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Adiponectin has antilipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, while tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) reduces insulin sensitivity and has proinflammatory effects. We examined (1) the extent to which hypoadiponectinemia and TNF-α activation are features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and (2) whether serum levels of these markers correlate with the severity of histological changes in 109 subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including 80 with NASH and 29 with simple steatosis. By multivariate analysis, subjects with NASH had reduced adiponectin level and increased TNF-α and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2)-but not leptin levels, compared with controls matched by age, sex, and body mass index; these differences were independent of the increased insulin resistance (by homeostasis model [HOMA-IR]) in NASH. When compared with simple steatosis, NASH was associated with lower adiponectin levels and higher HOMA-IR, but there were no significant differences in the levels of TNF-α and sTNFR2. The majority of subjects with steatohepatitis (77%) had adiponectin levels less than 10 μg/mL and HOMA-IR greater than 3 units, but only 33% of those with pure steatosis had these findings. HOMA-IR and low serum adiponectin were also independently associated with increased grades of hepatic necroinflammation. In conclusion, hypoadiponectinemia is a feature of NASH independent of insulin resistance. Reduced adiponectin level is associated with more extensive necroinflammation and may contribute to the development of necroinflammatory forms of NAFLD.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly malignancy that is increasing in incidence in developed countries. The emergence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for about half of this increase in HCC, although the etiology of HCC in 15%-50% of new HCC cases remains unclear. The most common form of chronic liver disease in developed countries is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which encompasses a broad spectrum of histopathology. The prevalence of NAFLD, including the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is increasing with the growing epidemics of diabetes and obesity. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and its related complications. Growing evidence suggests that NASH accounts for a large proportion of idiopathic or cryptogenic cirrhosis, which is associated with the typical risk factors for NASH. HCC is a rare, although important complication of NAFLD. Diabetes and obesity have been established as independent risk factors for the development of HCC. New evidence also suggests that hepatic iron deposition increases the risk of HCC in NASH-derived cirrhosis. Multiple case reports and case reviews of HCC in the setting of NASH support the associations of diabetes and obesity with the risk of HCC, as well as suggest age and advanced fibrosis as significant risks. Insulin resistance and its subsequent inflammatory cascade that is associated with the development of NASH appear to play a significant role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. The complications of NASH, including cirrhosis and HCC, are expected to increase with the growing epidemic of diabetes and obesity.

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a significant form of chronic liver disease in adults and children. The natural history of NASH ranges from indolent to end-stage liver disease. Current studies are focusing on identification of histologic and/or clinical markers of progression. NASH may be an underlying cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis, and the lesions of NASH may recur in allograft livers. An expanding array of clinical conditions and pathogenetic mechanisms have been identified, but many cases remain \"idiopathic\"; lack of significant alcohol use is, by definition, common to all cases. Neither clinical evaluation nor laboratory values can ensure either the diagnosis or the exclusion of NASH, and liver biopsy interpretation continues to be considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. The lesions in NASH are similar but not identical to those of alcoholic steatohepatitis; exact, specific histologic criteria for the diagnosis are currently under discussion. The lesions most commonly accepted for NASH include steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, mild diffuse lobular mixed acute and chronic inflammation, and perivenular, perisinusoidal collagen deposition. Zone 3 accentuation may be detected. Mallory's hyaline, vacuolated nuclei in periportal hepatocytes, lobular lipogranulomas, and PAS-diastase-resistant Kupffer cells are common. In biopsy specimens from children, portal inflammation may be more prominent than in adults. Progression of fibrosis may result in bridging septa and cirrhosis. The lesions of steatohepatitis may be noted concurrently with other forms of chronic liver disease. A histological \"grading and staging\" system has been developed to reflect the unique features of steatohepatitis, gradations of severity and fibrosis, and to promote uniform reporting of the histopathology.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Insulin resistance (IR) commonly is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To establish whether IR causes NASH, this study was undertaken to determine if improving IR would improve the histologic features that define NASH. Thirty adults with prior biopsy evidence of NASH were enrolled to receive rosiglitazone, 4 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. All patients were overweight (body mass index [BMI] &amp;gt; 25 kg/m2) and 23% were severely obese (BMI &amp;gt; 35 kg/m2); 50% had impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained before beginning treatment and at treatment completion. Twenty-six patients had posttreatment biopsies; of these, 22 had initial protocol liver biopsies that met published criteria for NASH on subsequent blinded evaluation. Within this initial NASH group, the mean global necroinflammatory score significantly improved with treatment and biopsies of 10 patients (45%) no longer met published criteria for NASH after treatment. Significant improvement in hepatocellular ballooning and zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis also occurred. Five patients withdrew early; the 25 patients completing 48 weeks of treatment had significantly improved insulin sensitivity and mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (104 initially, 42 U/L at the end of treatment). Adverse effects led to withdrawal of 3 patients (10%). Weight gain occurred in 67% of patients and the median weight increase was 7.3%. Within 6 months of completing treatment, liver enzyme levels had increased to near pre-treatment levels. In conclusion, improving insulin sensitivity with rosiglitazone resulted in improved histologic markers of NASH, an observation suggesting that insulin resistance contributes to its development and that improving insulin sensitivity may be important in treating this liver disease.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background &amp; Aims: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains poorly understood. Although apoptosis is a common mechanism of liver injury, the extent and clinical significance of apoptosis in NASH has not been examined. Thus, the aims of this study were to quantify hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH, correlate it with disease severity, and identify possible mechanisms of apoptosis induction. Methods: Hepatocyte apoptosis was assessed in NASH, simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and controls without liver disease using the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry for activated caspases 3 and 7. Liver specimens were also graded according to the magnitude of inflammation and fibrosis. Results: TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with NASH compared with simple steatosis and controls. Unexpectedly, TUNEL-positive cells were also greater in NASH vs. alcoholic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated active caspases 3 and 7 in NASH specimens, confirming the occurrence of apoptosis in this disease. A positive correlation was observed between hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory activity, respectively. The Fas receptor was strongly expressed in hepatocytes in liver specimens from NASH patients as compared with controls. Conclusions: Hepatocyte apoptosis is significantly increased in patients with NASH and correlates with disease severity, suggesting that antiapoptotic therapy may be useful in this syndrome.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease for which there is no known effective therapy. A proportion of patients with NASH progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is considered one of the clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in which insulin resistance plays a central role. This prospective study evaluates the role of insulin-sensitizing agent in treatment of NASH. Eighteen nondiabetic patients with biopsy-proven NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 48 weeks. Tests of insulin sensitivity and body composition as well as liver biopsies were performed before and at the end of treatment. By 48 weeks, serum alanine aminotransferase values fell to normal in 72% of patients. Hepatic fat content and size as determined by magnetic resonance imaging decreased, and glucose and free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin were uniformly improved. Histological features of steatosis, cellular injury, parenchymal inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis were significantly improved from baseline (all P &lt; 0.05). Using strict criteria, histological improvement occurred in two-thirds of patients. Pioglitazone was well tolerated; the main side effects were weight gain (averaging 4%) and an increase in total body adiposity. In conclusion, these results indicate that treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent can lead to improvement in biochemical and histological features of NASH and support the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. The long-term safety and benefits of pioglitazone require further study.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic liver disease have similar pathological features. Because CYP2E1 plays a key role in alcoholic liver disease with its ability to stimulate lipid peroxidation, we tested the proposal that CYP2E1 could also be a factor in the development of NASH. In a dietary model - mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet - liver injury was associated with both induction of CYP2E1 and a 100-fold increase in hepatic content of lipid peroxides. Microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid oxidases contributed to the formation of these lipid peroxides, and in vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that CYP2E1 was the major catalyst. To further define the role of CYP2E1 as an initiator of oxidative stress in NASH, Cyp2e1-/-mice were administered the MCD diet. CYP2E1 deficiency neither prevented the development of NASH nor abrogated the increased microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation, indicating the operation of a non-CYP2E1 peroxidase pathway. In Cyp2e1-/- mice with NASH (but not in wild-type mice), CYP4A10 and CYP4A14 were upregulated. Furthermore, hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation was substantially inhibited by anti-mouse CYP4A10 antibody in vitro. These results show that experimental NASH is strongly associated with hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation. CYP2E1, the main enzyme associated with that process in wild-type mice, is not unique among P450 proteins in catalyzing peroxidation of endogenous lipids. We have now identified CYP4A enzymes as alternative initiators of oxidative stress in the liver.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The definable causes of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) include jejunoileal bypass surgery (JIB), other causes of rapid and profound weight loss in obese subjects, total parenteral nutrition, drugs, industrial toxins, copper toxicity, and disorders characterized by extreme insulin resistance. However, the etiopathogenesis in most cases of NASH appears multifactorial. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia are often associated with hepatic steatosis, and although this does not invariably lead to NASH, the fatty liver is vulnerable to hepatocellular injury initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is critical to understand not only the triggers for hepatitis (injury and inflammation) in NASH but also how this is perpetuated as chronic liver disease. The present focus is on whether the biochemical processes that generate oxidative stress lead to hepatocyte injury and secondary recruitment of inflammation or whether inflammation is the primary mediator of liver cell injury. Insulin resistance is a reproducible pathogenic factor in NASH. It favors accumulation of free fatty acids in the liver and predisposes to oxidative stress by stimulating microsomal lipid peroxidases and by the direct effects of high insulin levels in decreasing mitochondrial β-oxidation. CYP2E1 is normally suppressed by insulin but is invariably increased in the livers of patients with NASH. In rodent dietary models of steatohepatitis, CYP2E1 is the catalyst of microsomal lipid peroxidation, while in Cyp 2e1 nullizygous mice, CYP4A proteins are induced and function as alternative microsomal lipid peroxidases. Other studies implicate activation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor-α (PPARα) as leading to NASH; PPARα is a transcription factor that governs both microsomal (via CYP4A) and peroxisomal (β-oxidation) pathways of lipid oxidation and ultimately production of ROS. Increased lipid peroxidation is a crucial difference between the livers of rodents with experimental NASH and those of ob/ob genetically obese mice that have uncomplicated steatosis. Administration of endotoxin, through the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), provokes liver inflammation with hepatocyte injury in the steatotic liver. This may be particularly relevant in JIB and has been suggested as a pathogenic mechanism in primary NASH. It has been proposed that inheriting one or more copies of the hemochromatosis gene, C282Y, promotes fibrotic progression in NASH because of increased hepatic iron deposition, but recent studies have failed to confirm this. The relationship between the severity of hepatitis in NASH and progression to cirrhosis implies that products of the inflammatory infiltrate play a role in fibrogenesis. In summary, NASH can be regarded as the hepatic consequence of the metabolic syndrome (or syndrome X). Attention should now shift from steatosis, a generally benign process that is less evident in the advanced stages of cirrhosis, to the mechanisms for hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. In particular, the genetic, molecular, and cellular factors that ordain and moderate fibrosis in the context of steatohepatitis will be of greatest relevance to effective therapy and clinical outcome.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background and Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that occasionally progresses to cirrhosis but usually has a benign course. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the hemochromatosis mutation Cys282Tyr in development of the mild hepatic iron overload found in some patients with NASH and its association with hepatic damage in these patients. Methods: Fifty-one patients with NASH were studied. The presence of the Cys282Tyr mutation was tested in all patients, and the data were analyzed with respect to the histological grade of steatosis, inflammation, Perls' staining, hepatic iron concentration (HIC), and serum iron indices. Results: Thirty-one percent of patients with NASH were either homozygous or heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. This mutation was significantly associated with Perls' stain grade (P &lt; 0.005), HIC (P &lt; 0.005), and transferrin saturation percentage (P &lt; 0.005) but not with serum ferritin levels. Linear regression analysis showed that increased hepatic iron (Perls' stain or HIC) had the greatest association with the severity of fibrosis (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: The Cys282Tyr mutation is responsible for most of the mild iron overload found in NASH and thus has a significant association with hepatic damage in these patients. Heterozygosity for the hemochromatosis gene mutation therefore cannot always be considered benign.</td>\n",

       "      <td>This study aims to determine the presence of the components of the metabolic syndrome in primary nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to assess the role of liver disease in the genesis of peripheral hyperinsulinemia. Nineteen patients (18 men and 1 woman; mean age, ± SD, 38 ± 10 years; body mass index [BMI], 26 ± 2 kg/m2) with histologic evidence of NASH were enrolled; 19 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were investigated as controls. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test, and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT), analyzed by minimal modeling technique, was performed. Compared with controls, the NASH group had lower insulin sensitivity (3.84 ± 2.44 vs. 7.48 ± 3.01 10-4 × min-1/μU/mL; P =.0003) and higher total insulin secretion (21 ± 13 vs. 10 ± 3 nmol/L in 240 minutes; P =.001). Hepatic insulin extraction was similar in both groups (69.8% ± 16.1% vs. 70.2% ± 18.3%; P =.854). According to the results of the oral glucose tolerance test, no patient was classified as diabetic, 5 were classified as glucose intolerant, and 1 was classified as having impaired fasting glycemia. Nine patients (47%) had at least the 2 minimum criteria required to define the metabolic syndrome according to the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR). In conclusion, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance occur frequently in patients with NASH; these conditions do not stem from a reduced hepatic insulin extraction but from an enhanced pancreatic insulin secretion compensatory to reduced insulin sensitivity. The derangement of insulin regulation, often associated with the metabolic syndrome, may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of NASH.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that has been shown to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This article reviews the prevalence of NAFLD and the factors associated this disorder, and with the more advanced stages of NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In the general population, the estimated prevalence ranges from 3% to 24%, with most estimates in the 6% to 14% range. NAFLD is extremely common among patients undergoing bariatric surgery, ranging from 84% to 96%. In these patients, 25% to 55% have NASH, 34% to 47% have fibrosis, and 2% to 12% have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. NAFLD appears to be most strongly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance states including diabetes and with other features of the metabolic syndrome, such as high triglycerides and low HDL. It appears to be more common in men, and it increases with increasing age and after menopause. Some data suggest that Mexican Americans are more likely to have NAFLD and blacks are less likely compared with non-Hispanic whites. More advanced stages of NAFLD are associated with older age, higher body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, high triglycerides, and/or insulin resistance. An AST/ALT ratio greater &gt;1 may also indicate more severe disease. Although hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in the setting of NAFLD, the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of NAFLD have not been established. More prospective studies are needed to determine the true risk factors for the development and progression of NAFLD to help identify patients at highest risk who might benefit from treatment trials.

       "      <td>The favorable metabolic effects of telmisartan have been attributed to its angiotensin II receptor blockade and action as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. We previously reported that administration of telmisartan markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in the liver in mice fed a high-fat diet. In the present study, we further examined the protective effect of telmisartan in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model induced by feeding Wistar rats an L-methionine- and choline-deficient (MCA) diet. In the first experiment, rats were fed an MCA diet for 8 weeks with or without telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day). Liver fibrosis was observed by Masson trichrome staining, and co-treatment was shown to attenuate liver fibrosis. In the second experiment, Wistar rats were fed an MCA diet for 20 weeks, and telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) was administered during weeks 0-20 as a preventive model or weeks 8-20 as a therapeutic model. As a result, telmisartan administration in both models significantly attenuated liver fibrosis and an increase in serum AST. Of importance, the HGF concentration in the liver was significantly increased in the telmisartan-treated group. Overall, telmisartan showed a potential action to improve NASH induced by an MCA diet, possibly due to increased HGF production through partial agonist of PPAR-γ. These favorable characteristics of telmisartan as a partial agonist of PPAR-γ may provide a benefit in the treatment of metabolic syndrome beyond its blood pressure-lowering effect.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinico-pathologic spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although simple or bland steatosis follows a relatively benign clinical course, NASH can potentially progress to cirrhosis (approximately 10 to 15 percent) and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD occurs in an estimated 25 to 30 percent of the US general population, while NASH is reported in 2 to 3 percent of the population. Even though common explanation for the increased prevalence of NAFLD is the increased rate of obesity, the risk of developing NAFLD and NASH is not limited to overweight and obese individuals. Currently, the only way to diagnose NASH or to assess the stage of fibrosis is by obtaining a liver biopsy. Liver biopsy is invasive, expensive, and associated with potential risks, including post biopsy pain, bleeding, organ perforation, and even death; serious complications can occur in 0.3 percent of liver biopsies with 0.01 percent being fatal. This review examines the current strategies for development of the non-invasive techniques that will one day replace liver biopsy and serve as a non-invasive gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of NASH. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Aims: Oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oleuropein, the active constituent of olive leaf, possesses anti-oxidant, hypoglycaemic, and hypolipidaemic activities. We aimed to investigate the preventive effects of olive leaf extract on hepatic fat accumulation in a rat model of NASH. Methods: Spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent rats were fed a diet of AIN-93G with or without olive leaf extract (500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg diet, and control; 5 rats each) for 23 weeks. Serological and histopathological findings, anti-oxidative activity, and the alteration of fatty acid synthesis in the liver were evaluated. Results: Histopathologically, a diet of AIN-93G containing more than 1000 mg/kg olive leaf extract had a preventive effect for the occurrence of NASH. Thioredoxin-1 expression in the liver was more evident in rats fed this diet, and 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the liver was less evident in these rats. There were no significant differences in the activities of hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase among the groups. Conclusions: Our data suggest that olive leaf extract may help prevent NASH, presumably through its anti-oxidative activity. © 2010 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.</td>\n",

Methods: NASH was induced in male ob/ob mice by methionine-choline deficient (MCD) and high-fat (H) diets. Two animal groups received or not SNAC orally for four weeks since the beginning of the treatment. Two other groups were submitted to MCD and H diets for 60 days receiving SNAC only from the 31st to the 60th day. Results: SNAC administration inhibited the development of NASH in all groups, leading to a marked decrease in macro and microvacuolar steatosis and in hepatic lipid peroxidation in the MCD group. SNAC treatment reversed the development of NASH in animals treated for 60 days with MCD or H diets, which received SNAC only from the 31st to the 60th day.

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prevalent liver diseases in the Western world. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of histologic subgroups, with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as the most aggressive form. The risk of developing NAFLD is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is a multiple-hit process resulting from hepatic fat deposition that is related to several conditions, including insulin resistance and central obesity. Additional hits, such as oxidative stress or adipocytokines produced by white adipose tissue, can further enhance liver damage leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Although NAFLD is often the primary liver disease of metabolic conditions, it can also exacerbate other liver diseases such as hepatitis C (HCV); indeed, more than 50% of patients with HCV have hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis can be related to host factors (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance) or to the genotype of virus (e.g., HCV genotype 3). Increasing evidence suggests that hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and obesity in the setting of HCV have a negative impact on the efficacy of treatment and hepatic progression of fibrosis. © 2008 Future Drugs Ltd.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasingly recognized as the most common pathological conditions affecting the liver. In concert with the increase in Body Mass Index in developed countries that has occurred during the last decades, more and more individuals referred for evaluation of abnormal liver tests are found to have NAFLD. In most cases, the increase in fat within the liver is not associated with impaired liver structure or function in the long-term. However, liver steatosis should be considered to be a marker of the metabolic syndrome. A minority of patients with NAFLD develop liver cirrhosis but NAFLD is probably the most common underlying cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Patients with NAFLD have an increased cardiovascular mortality as well as increase in liver related complications compared with matched controls. The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected NAFLD depends heavily on the setting. In whom and when a liver biopsy is indicated is controversial. An adequate history is of major importance and when alcohol is suspected to be a contributing factor to the liver steatosis, several biochemical and clinical parameters may differentiate alcoholic fatty liver and NAFLD. Unfortunately, no histological gold standard is available for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and there is still a significant diversity among pathologist concerning the minimal requirements for the term NASH. Management of patients with NAFLD should be aimed at fighting the metabolic risk factors such as visceral obesity, hyperglycemia, type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertriglyceridemia. DM has been shown to be a predictor of worsening of fibrosis. Successful lifestyle modification with increased exercise and decreased food intake is able to remove the accumulation of liver fat and can reverse insulin resistance. Unfortunately, there are no well-controlled, randomized trials of weight control as therapy for NAFLD. Some pharmacological pilot trials have been undertaken in NAFLD, but no proved treatment for all patients with NAFLD and/or NASH is available at the current time.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Objective. To investigate the incidence rate and causes of cirrhosis in a Norwegian population. We also sought to assess the degree of underreporting of cirrhosis to the Norwegian Death Registry. Material and methods. All 1264 patients treated at Aker University Hospital in the period January 1999 to March 2004 who were given a diagnosis indicating cirrhosis, chronic liver disease or symptoms possibly attributable to cirrhosis were screened retrospectively. A search of the registry of histological diagnoses at Department of Pathology was also carried out. Based on the results of histological examinations and non-histological criteria, cirrhosis was confirmed in 194 patients. Calculations of the incidence rate of cirrhosis and frequencies of the various etiologies were based on 93 patients living in the catchment area of the hospital. Causes of death were retrieved from the Norwegian Death Registry. Results. The incidence rate of cirrhosis was 134 per million per year. The majority of cases were due to alcoholic liver disease (53%), followed by viral liver disease (12%), various autoimmune liver diseases (12%), hemochromatosis (4%) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (3%). No etiology was established in 16%, a group with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, indicating that some of these cases were possibly caused by NASH. Among 105 deaths in this cohort of 194 cirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of cirrhosis was absent in the Norwegian Death Registry in 30% of cases. Conclusions. The incidence of cirrhosis in Norway is relatively low, with alcohol as the most important etiologic factor.

       "      <td>Obesity has emerged as a significant global health problem in the pediatric population. Pediatric liver disease is a serious complication of childhood obesity. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an entity in the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from fat in the liver - simple steatosis, NASH/steatohepatitis - fat with in ammation and/or fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis when fat may no longer be present. NASH is associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance (IR), and hypertriglyceridemia. Children get NAFLD, and the incidence of this pediatric liver disease is rising as childhood obesity becomes increasingly prevalent. Although much remains to be learned about pediatric NAFLD, it is already evident that children with NASH risk progressive liver damage, including cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, and other causes of fatty liver in childhood must be excluded. Gradual weight loss through increased regular exercise and a low-fat, low-refined carbohydrate diet appears to be effective. Drug treatments are being developed. The important message is that childhood obesity poses important health problems, including but not limited to potentially severe chronic liver disease. Early diagnosis of children who are only overweight is a worthy goal so that strategies to limit obesity can be instituted as early as possible. Identification of genetic risks is important, but management will invariably require changes in environmental factors. In addition to individual treatment, a multifaceted, societal initiative is required for solving the childhood obesity epidemic. © 2007 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.</td>\n",

Tamoxifen-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may increase the demand on oncologists, not only with regard to screening for diabetes, but also for the suggested link of NASH with high incidence of coronary heart disease. At present, there is no guideline for treatment of hyperlipidaemia associated with tamoxifen-induced NASH. However, exemstane (and other aromatase inhibitors) has been shown to lower triglyceride and have a neutral effect on low-denisty lipoprotein and cholesterol levels. These may be alternative agents if severe progressive liver disease or hyperlipidaemia were encountered with tamoxifen administration. Other lipid-lowering medications may have potential benefits in the treatment of tamoxifen-induced NASH and is discussed in this article. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Objectives: Among numerous factors which account for the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation is considered to play a pivotal role. We performed a 13C-based breath test with a medium-chain fatty acid to non-invasively assess total body β-oxidation in patients with NASH and in healthy controls. Methods: We performed a simplified 13CO2-based breath test in 16 patients with histologically proven NASH and 24 healthy controls. One hundred milligrams of sodium 13C-octanoate dissolved in 200 ml of water were orally administered and breath samples were collected before and during 3 h following administration. The samples were analysed for the cumulative 13CO2 recovery (%-cum-dose) by non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. Additionally, data of 69 patients who had undergone a 13C-octanoate breath test for the assessment of gastric emptying were retrospectively evaluated for the %-cum-dose. Results: The cumulative 13CO2 recovery 3 h after the administration of the substrate did not differ among patients with NASH and controls (34.6 ± 7.0% vs. 34.6 ± 6.5%, P = 0.90). Compared with men, women yielded a significantly higher cumulative 13CO2 excretion in both controls (30.1 ± 5.7% vs. 38.5 ± 4.4%, P = 0.0008) and NASH patients (30.2 ± 5.4% vs. 39.0 ± 6.5%, P = 0.031). Forty-two of 69 patients (61%) of the gastric emptying group showed a normal gastric emptying rate. Among these patients, women also demonstrated a tendency for a higher 13CO2 recovery compared with men (P = 0.055). This was not the case in 27 patients with delayed gastric emptying (P = 0.47). Conclusions: Though hepatic mitochondrial function might be impaired in patients with NASH, total β-oxidation of octanoic acid remains normal. Gender-specific metabolic modifications seem to account for significant differences of the cumulative 13CO2 recovery in women and men. This may have further consequences for the appraisal of 13C breath tests which involve octanoic acid. Further trials focusing on the assessment of body composition and energy expenditure could contribute essential further information. © 2005 Lippincott Williams &amp;amp; Wilkins.</td>\n",

       "      <td>To explore the role of retinoic acid (RA) in liver, we developed transgenic mice expressing retinoic acid receptor α dominant negative form (RARE) in hepatocytes using by albumin promoter and enhancer. At 4 months of age, the RARE transgenic mice developed microvesicular steatosis and spotty focal necrosis. Mitochondrial β-oxidation activity of fatty acids and expression of its related enzymes including VLCAD, LCAD and HCD were down-regulated. On the other hand, peroxisomal β-oxidation and its related enzymes including AOX and BFE were up-regulated. Expression of CYP4a10, CYP4a12 and CYP4a14 was increased, suggesting that ω-oxidation of fatty acids in microsome was accelerated. In addition, formation of H2O2 and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was increased. After 12 months of age, these mice developed liver tumors which are hepatocellular carcinoma or adenoma. The incidence of tumor formation was increased with age. Expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1 was enhanced, and TCF-4/β-catenin complex was increased whereas RARα/β-catenin complex was decreased. Feeding on high RA diet reversed histological and biochemical abnormalities, and inhibited occurrence of liver tumor. Taken together, hepatic loss of RA function leads to development of steatohepatitis and liver tumor and RA plays an important role in preventing hepatocarcinogenesis in association with fatty acid metabolism and Wnt signaling. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

       "      <td>Cytokines are mediators of cellular communication produced by multiple liver cell types. Cytokines can directly induce either necrosis or apoptosis. They can also recruit such cells as neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can mediate liver damage. Increased levels of hepatotoxic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α are documented in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and have been shown to play a mechanistic role in both of these disease processes. Transforming growth factor-β is a profibrotic cytokine that is critical in hepatic fibrosis. Beneficial cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and -6, also exist. Such beneficial cytokines as adiponectin are made outside the liver and appear to protect against ALD and NASH. This article reviews the relevance of cytokines in human and experimental forms of liver injury, focusing on modulation of cytokines and the use of beneficial cytokines in treatment and prevention of liver injury in ALD, NASH, and hepatitis C.

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), along with other forms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an increasingly common clinico-pathological syndrome. It is frequently associated with obesity, especially visceral fat, and type 2 diabetes, and is intimately related to markers of the insulin resistance syndrome. Both the prevalence and the severity of liver steatosis are related to body mass index, waist circumference, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and impaired glucose tolerance. The pathophysiology of NASH involves two steps: 1) insulin resistance, which causes steatosis; 2) and oxidative stress, which produces lipid peroxidation and activates inflammatory cytokines. The identification of subjects who may progress from fatty liver to NASH, and from NASH to fibrosis/cirrhosis is an important clinical challenge as well as the finding of appropriate therapy that could prevent such deleterious process. Substantial weight loss is accompanied by a marked attenuation of insulin resistance and related metabolic syndrome and, concomitantly, by an important regression of liver steatosis in most patients, although mild inflammation may be detected in some subjects. Thus, NASH may be considered as another disease of affluence, as is the insulin resistance syndrome and perhaps being part of it.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Liver steatosis is a common human disease, most often caused by long-term alcohol consumption. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by similar histopathological features to those observed in alcoholic liver disease, but occurs in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Several aetiological factors contribute to NASH: obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, pregnancy, different chemical intoxications, parenteral nutrition, jejeuno-ileal bypass, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, nutritional protein deficiency and congenital metabolic disorders. Biochemically, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and their ensuing damage are implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH and alcoholic steatohepatitis (probably resulting from free fatty acids in the mitochondria, and induction of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2E1 in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cells). This paper deals with the pathomechanisms, clinical findings and currently available therapies for NASH. The potential use of metadoxine in the treatment of NASH is also discussed.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Cushing's syndrome (CS) due to ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS) has a high morbidity and mortality, because of the underlying tumor and the sequelae of severe hypercortisolemia. Therefore, rapid treatment of ectopic CS is mandatory. Scintigraphy shows that up to 80% of ectopic ACTH-producing tumors have somatostatin receptors. While this suggests that somatostatin analogs may reduce ACTH production and treat patients with EAS, the therapeutic role of these agents is still evolving. Here we demonstrate the spectrum of responses to octreotide therapy in 3 patients with EAS. Diagnostic imaging with the 111In-pentetreotide scan did not predict the therapeutic response to octreotide. Two patients with positive somatostatin receptor scintigraphy failed to respond to octreotide, while one with a negative scan reached eucortisolemia on a maintenance dose of 75 μg octreotide twice daily or octreotide LAP 30 mg per month. We conclude that octreotide is not a first line agent to control hypercortisolemia but may be a useful agent when other inhibitors of steroidogenesis fail or parenteral administration is required. Before therapy an octreotide challenge test may predict therapeutic response. Cortisol levels should be monitored regularly on somatostatin analog therapy, because of its unpredictable long-term pharmacodynamic profile. ©2003, Editrice Kurtis.Indications:3 patients with refractory Cushing's syndrome (CS) due to ectopic adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) secretion (EAS).

Patient 2: 100 mcg as sc injection, then 100 mcg tid (=300 mcg), then 50 mcg bid (=100 mcg daily) to 75 mcg bid (150 mcg daily), then Sandostatin LAR 30 mg every 4 weeks. Patient 3: 100 mcg tid (=300 mcg daily) as sc injection. Duration: single dose (patient 1); single dose, then 1 day, then &gt;1 month (patient 2); 1 day (patient 3).Results:Patient 1 with metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis underwent total thyroidectomy. Residual disease remained and postoperative ACTH levels were elevated. Decrease in ACTH after treatment with metyrapone, mitotane and ketoconazole was transient. ACTH levels increased after a single dose of Sandostatin. Patient 2 had elevated ACTH levels of unknown origin; response to ketoconazole was minimal. Sandostatin 100 mcg single dose given to control flushing suppressed cortisol for 2-3 days. Ketoconazole was stopped and Sandostatin challenge (100 mcg tid for 1 day) was given; serum cortisol levels decreased markedly. Patient then received Sandostatin 50 to 75 mcg bid to maintain normal cortisol levels, later switched to Sandostatin LAR 30 mg/month. Symptoms have improved and patient has returned to work. Patient 3 with diabetes mellitus and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis had elevated ACTH not responding to metyrapone and aminoglutethimide; there was also no response to SandostatinAdverseEffects:No adverse events were mentioned.AuthorsConclusions:We conclude that octreotide is not a first line agent to control hypercortisolemia but may be a useful agent when other inhibitors of steroidogenesis fail or parenteral administration is required.

       "      <td>Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the term used for a common form of fatty liver presenting in adults with varied clinical manifestations. The most common presentation is asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes (AST or SGOT and ALT or SGPT), which can be discovered incidentally in the course of an annual checkup, life insurance examination, or as part of surrogate screening before blood donation. At the other end of the clinical spectrum is the patient with complications from cryptogenic cirrhosis, who also shows a lack of evidence of alcohol as an etiological factor in pathogenesis. Clinical associations of probable relevance include gender (female), obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but many patients do not conform to any of these stereotypes (e.g., young men of normal weight with normal fasting glucose and lipid levels). Liver biopsy confirms the diagnosis of NASH, the association of steatosis with an inflammatory response being the sine qua non for the condition and 'creeping fibrosis' being a variable but possibly sinister feature. Newer imaging techniques may provide convincing evidence of steatosis, but they give little insight into ongoing fibrosis, and liver biopsy therefore remains the gold standard. The mainstay of treatment remains judicious weight loss coupled with positive dietary advice, including the ingestion of adequate but not excessive vitamins. After initial encouraging data, the assessment of ursodeoxycholic acid currently being studied under randomized controlled conditions is eagerly awaited.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Glycerol was shown recently to be metabolized to formaldehyde by microsomes from chowfed control rats (Winters et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 153: 612-617, 1988). In the present study, experiments were carried out to evaluate the oxidation of glycerol by microsomes isolated from rats treated with inducers of different isozymes of cytochrome P-450. The oxidation of glycerol to formaldehyde was increased in microsomes from rats treated with pyrazole, ethanol or acetone relative to their respective controls, but not after treatment with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene. This reaction was sensitive to inhibition by carbon monoxide and was inhibited by compounds known to be effective substrates for P-450j, e.g. aniline, ethanol, pyrazole and 4-methylpyrazole. Treatment with pyrazole caused an increase in Vmax for glycerol oxidation but did not affect the ifKitm (about 15 mM) for glycerol, as compared to saline controls. Evidence that the product of glycerol metabolism is formaldehyde was provided by the observation that this product served as a substrate for the glutathionedependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and the amount of formaldehyde detected was identical to that detected by the Nash reaction. By utilizing [14C]glycerol, and coupling the formaldehyde dehydrogenase reaction to the formate dehydrogenase reaction, 14CO2 could be detected, indicating that the formaldehyde produced was derived from the added glycerol. These results suggest that glycerol is not metabolically inert when added to microsomes but serves as an effective substrate for the cytochrome P-450j isozyme, extending the alcohol substrate specificity of this enzyme to poly-ols. The production of formaldehyde from glycerol may require caution since glycerol is often present in microsomal or reconstituted systems. © 1990.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Background &amp;amp; Aims There is evidence from clinical studies that compromised intestinal epithelial permeability contributes to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the exact mechanisms are not clear. Mice with disruption of the gene (F11r) encoding junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) have defects in intestinal epithelial permeability. We used these mice to study how disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier contributes to NASH. Methods Male C57BL/6 (control) or F11r-/- mice were fed a normal diet or a diet high in saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol (HFCD) for 8 weeks. Liver and intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. Intestinal epithelial permeability was assessed in mice by measuring permeability to fluorescently labeled dextran. The intestinal microbiota were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We also analyzed biopsy specimens from proximal colons of 30 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 19 subjects without NAFLD (controls) undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Results F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD, but not a normal diet, developed histologic and pathologic features of severe NASH including steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis, whereas control mice fed a HFCD developed only modest steatosis. Interestingly, there were no differences in body weight, ratio of liver weight:body weight, or glucose homeostasis between control and F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD. In these mice, liver injury was associated with significant increases in mucosal inflammation, tight junction disruption, and intestinal epithelial permeability to bacterial endotoxins, compared with control mice or F11r-/- mice fed a normal diet. The HFCD led to a significant increase in inflammatory microbial taxa in F11r-/- mice, compared with control mice. Administration of oral antibiotics or sequestration of bacterial endotoxins with sevelamer hydrochloride reduced mucosal inflammation and restored normal liver histology in F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD. Protein and transcript levels of JAM-A were significantly lower in the intestinal mucosa of patients with NAFLD than without NAFLD; decreased expression of JAM-A correlated with increased mucosal inflammation. Conclusions Mice with defects in intestinal epithelial permeability develop more severe steatohepatitis after a HFCD than control mice, and colon tissues from patients with NAFLD have lower levels of JAM-A and higher levels of inflammation than subjects without NAFLD. These findings indicate that intestinal epithelial barrier function and microbial dysbiosis contribute to the development of NASH. Restoration of intestinal barrier integrity and manipulation of gut microbiota might be developed as therapeutic strategies for patients with NASH. © 2016 AGA Institute</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of liver disease from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is commonly associated with features of the metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome (‘Metabolic/Obese NAFLD’) and may therefore predict type 2 diabetes (T2DM). For this review, we searched for prospective studies examining whether NAFLD predicts T2DM, and if so, whether this occurs independently of factors such as age and obesity. These studies included NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasonography (n = 6) or liver enzymes (n = 14). All ultrasonography studies found NAFLD to predict the risk of T2DM independently of age, and in 4 out of 6 studies NAFLD was also a predictor independently of BMI. NAFLD was a predictor of T2DM in all 14 studies where NAFLD was diagnosed by liver enzymes. In 12 of these studies, ALT or AST or GGT were significant predictors of T2DM risk, independently of age and BMI. NAFLD, however, is heterogeneous and may also be caused by common genetic variants. The I148M variant in PNPLA3 and the E167K variant in TM6SF2 are both associated with increased liver fat content, but not features of the metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome. These genetic forms of NAFLD predict NASH and cirrhosis but not T2DM. Taken together these data imply that ‘Metabolic/Obese NAFLD’ predicts T2DM independently of age and obesity and support the role of hepatic insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance and therefore predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD can also be caused by common genetic variants, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) or the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). Since NAFL, irrespective of its cause, can progress to NASH and liver fibrosis, its definition is of interest. We reviewed the literature to identify data on definition of normal liver fat using liver histology and different imaging tools, and analyzed whether NAFLD caused by the gene variants is associated with insulin resistance. Histologically, normal liver fat content in liver biopsies is most commonly defined as macroscopic steatosis in less than 5% of hepatocytes. In the population-based Dallas Heart Study, the upper 95th percentile of liver fat measured by proton magnetic spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in healthy subjects was 5.6%, which corresponds to approximately 15% histological liver fat. When measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques such as the proton density fat fraction (PDFF), 5% macroscopic steatosis corresponds to a PDFF of 6% to 6.4%. In contrast to “Obese/metabolic NAFLD”, NAFLD caused by genetic variants is not associated with insulin resistance. This implies that NAFLD is heterogeneous and that “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” but not NAFLD due to the PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 genetic variants predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The growing epidemic of obesity, which causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more severe phenotype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has paralleled the increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accumulating evidence demonstrates that overnutrition and metabolic pathways can trigger modifications of DNA and histones via deregulation of chromatin modifiers, resulting in aberrant transcriptional activity. However, the epigenetic regulation of HCC development in NAFLD remains obscure. Here, we uncover key epigenetic regulators using both dietary and genetic obesitypromoted HCC models through quantitative expression profiling and characterize the oncogenic activities of histone deacetylase HDAC8 in NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. HDAC8 is directly upregulated by the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 where they are coexpressed in dietary obesity models of NASH and HCC. Lentiviral-mediated HDAC8 attenuation in vivo reversed insulin resistance and reduced NAFLD-associated tumorigenicity. HDAC8 modulation by genetic and pharmacologic approaches inhibited p53/p21-mediated apoptosis and G2-M phase cell-cycle arrest and stimulated β-catenin-dependent cell proliferation. Mechanistically, HDAC8 physically interacted with the chromatin modifier EZH2 to concordantly repress Wnt antagonists via histone H4 deacetylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. In human NAFLD-associated HCC, levels of SREBP-1, HDAC8, EZH2, H4 deacetylation, H3K27me3, and active β-catenin were all correlated positively in tumors compared with nontumor tissues. Overall, our findings show how HDAC8 drives NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, offering a novel epigenetic target to prevent or treat HCC in obese patients. © 2015 AACR.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Key issues in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the differentiation of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from simple steatosis and staging of liver fibrosis, as patients with NASH/advanced fibrosis are at greatest risk of developing complications of end-stage liver disease. The controlled attenuation parameter is the most promising noninvasive technique for detecting and quantifying hepatic steatosis, but needs to be implemented with the XL probe and compared with ultrasound that, despite its limitations, remains the most widely used method. Cytokeratin-18 is currently the most extensively validated serum marker of NASH as a stand-alone test or as part of prediction models. However, it is not widely available and thus has not been introduced yet into practice. Transient elastography, as well as FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores are the best methods to rule out severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, the high rate of unreliable results with transient elastography remains a challenge, which is not completely addressed by the use of the XL probe. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the general population, these noninvasive methods could be used in clinical practice as first-line tools to screen patients with NAFLD to help determine those who may still require a liver biopsy. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by intra-hepatic fat accumulation and mechanisms involved in its pathogenesis are not fully explained. Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) is a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. We investigated its activity in patients with fatty liver.LAL activity (nmol/spot/h) was measured in 100 adult healthy subjects (HS) and in 240 NAFLD patients. A sub-analysis on 35 patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was performed.Median LAL activity was 1.15 (0.95-1.72) in HS. It was significantly reduced in NAFLD [0.78 (0.61-1.01), p &lt; 0.001 vs. HS]. A further reduction was observed in the subgroup of NASH [0.67 (0.51-0.77), p &lt; 0.001 vs HS]. Patients with LAL activity below median had higher values of serum total cholesterol (p &lt;. 0.05) and LDL-c (p. &lt;. 0.05), and increased serum liver enzymes (ALT, p &lt; 0.001; AST, p &lt; 0.01; GGT, p. &lt;. 0.01). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with LAL activity below median were ALT (OR: 1.018, 95% CI 1.004-1.032, p = 0.011) and metabolic syndrome (OR: 2.551, 95% CI 1.241-5.245, p = 0.011), whilst statin use predicted a better LAL function (OR: 0.464, 95% CI 0.248-0.866, p. =. 0.016).Our findings suggest a strong association between impaired LAL activity and NAFLD. A better knowledge of the role of LAL may provide new insights in NAFLD pathogenesis. © 2015 The Authors.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Objective No therapy for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been approved so far. Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) is emerging as a therapeutic option, although its effect on NASH and related hepatic molecular pathways is unclear from human studies. We studied the effect of RYGB on pre-existent NASH and hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction-a key player in NASH pathogenesis -in a novel diet-induced mouse model nicely mimicking human disease. Design C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat highsucrose diet (HF-HSD). Results HF-HSD led to early obesity, insulin resistance and hypercholesterolaemia. HF-HSD consistently induced NASH (steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and inflammation) with fibrosis already after 12-week feeding. NASH was accompanied by hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, characterised by decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and IV activity, ATP depletion, ultrastructural abnormalities, together with higher 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) levels, increased uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) mRNA and free cholesterol accumulation. In our model of NASH and acquired mitochondrial dysfunction, RYGB induced sustained weight loss, improved insulin resistance and inhibited progression of NASH, with a marked reversal of fibrosis. In parallel, RYGB preserved hepatic MRC complex I activity, restored ATP levels, limited HNE production and decreased TNF-α mRNA. Conclusions Progression of NASH and NASH-related hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction can be prevented by RYGB. RYGB preserves respiratory chain complex activity, thereby restoring energy output, probably by limiting the amount of oxidative stress and TNF-α. These data suggest that modulation of hepatic mitochondrial function contributes to the favourable effect of RYBG on established NASH.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Morphine is metabolized in humans to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). The hepatobiliary disposition of both metabolites relies upon multidrug resistance-associated proteins Mrp3 and Mrp2, located on the sinusoidal and canalicularmembrane, respectively. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the severe stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alters xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme and transporter function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NASH contributes to the large interindividual variability and postoperative adverse events associated with morphine therapy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control diet or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet to induce NASH. Radiolabeled morphine (2.5 mg/kg, 30 μCi/kg) was administered intravenously, and plasma and bile (0-150 or 0-240 minutes), liver and kidney, and cumulative urine were analyzed formorphine and M3G. The antinociceptive response to M6G (5 mg/kg) was assessed (0-12 hours) after direct intraperitoneal administration since rats do not produce M6G. NASH caused a net decrease in morphine concentrations in the bile and plasma and a net increase in theM3G/morphine plasma area under the concentration-time curve ratio, consistent with upregulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase Ugt2b1. Despite increased systemic exposure to M3G, NASH resulted in decreased biliary excretion and hepatic accumulation of M3G. This shift toward systemic retention is consistent with the mislocalization of canalicular Mrp2 and increased expression of sinusoidalMrp3 in NASH andmay correlate to increased antinociception by M6G. Increased metabolism and altered transporter regulation in NASH provide a mechanistic basis for interindividual variability in morphine disposition that may lead to opioid-related toxicity.

       "      <td>Background &amp; Aims Sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by saturated fatty acids plays a role in lipotoxicity and the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We have reported that the interaction of JNK with mitochondrial Sab leads to inhibition of respiration, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell death and hepatotoxicity. We tested whether this pathway underlies palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. Methods Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) from adeno-shlacZ or adeno-shSab treated mice and HuH7 cells were used. Results In PMH, PA dose-dependently up to 1 mM stimulated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to mitochondrial β-oxidation. At â&gt;4;1.5 mM, PA gradually reduced OCR, followed by cell death. Inhibition of JNK, caspases or treatment with antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) protected PMH against cell death. Sab knockdown or a membrane permeable Sab blocking peptide prevented PA-induced mitochondrial impairment, but inhibited only the late phase of both JNK activation (beyond 4 h) and cell death. In PMH, PA increased p-PERK and its downstream target CHOP, but failed to activate the IRE-1α arm of the UPR. However, Sab silencing did not affect PA-induced PERK activation. Conversely, specific inhibition of PERK prevented JNK activation and cell death, indicating a major role upstream of JNK activation. Conclusions The effect of p-JNK on mitochondria plays a key role in PA-mediated lipotoxicity.

       "0     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis in the absence of a history of significant alcohol use or other known liver disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the progressive form of NAFLD. The Pathology Committee of the NASH Clinical Research Network designed and validated a histological feature scoring system that addresses the full spectrum of lesions of NAFLD and proposed a NAFLD activity score (NAS) for use in clinical trials. The scoring system comprised 14 histological features, 4 of which were evaluated semi-quantitatively: steatosis (0-3), lobular inflammation (0-2), hepatocellular ballooning (0-2), and fibrosis (0-4). Another nine features were recorded as present or absent. An anonymized study set of 50 cases (32 from adult hepatology services, 18 from pediatric hepatology services) was assembled, coded, and circulated. For the validation study, agreement on scoring and a diagnostic categorization (\"NASH,\" \"borderline,\" or \"not NASH\") were evaluated by using weighted kappa statistics. Inter-rater agreement on adult cases was: 0.84 for fibrosis, 0.79 for steatosis, 0.56 for injury, and 0.45 for lobular inflammation. Agreement on diagnostic category was 0.61. Using multiple logistic regression, five features were independently associated with the diagnosis of NASH in adult biopsies: steatosis (P = .009), hepatocellular ballooning (P = .0001), lobular inflammation (P = .0001), fibrosis (P = .0001), and the absence of lipogranulomas (P = .001). The proposed NAS is the unweighted sum of steatosis, lobular inflammation, and hepatocellular ballooning scores. In conclusion, we present a strong scoring system and NAS for NAFLD and NASH with reasonable inter-rater reproducibility that should be useful for studies of both adults and children with any degree of NAFLD. NAS of ≥5 correlated with a diagnosis of NASH, and biopsies with scores of less than 3 were diagnosed as \"not NASH.\" Copyright © 2005 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1     OBJECTIVE: Steatohepatitis is a morphological pattern of liver injury that may be seen in alcoholic or nonalcoholic liver disease. This pattern may occur with obesity, diabetes, the use of certain drugs, or the cause may be idiopathic. The well-recognized histopathological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) include hepatocellular steatosis and ballooning, mixed acute and chronic lobular inflammation, and zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis. Currently, there are no systems for grading necroinflammatory activity or for staging fibrosis as exist for various other forms of chronic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to develop such a grading and staging system and was based on review of liver biopsies from 51 patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis from Saint Louis University Health Sciences Center. METHODS: For determination of grade, 10 histological variables of activity were initially analyzed; an overall impression of mild, moderate, and severe was made and the variables considered to be most significant were used to develop the necroinflammatory grade. RESULTS: The histological lesions considered to be significant were: steatosis, ballooning, and intra-acinar and portal inflammation. A staging score was developed to reflect both location and extent of fibrosis. The fibrosis score was derived from the extent of zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis with possible additional portal/periportal fibrosis and architectural remodeling. Fibrosis stages are as follows: Stage 1, zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis; Stage 2, as above with portal fibrosis; Stage 3, as above with bridging fibrosis; and Stage 4, cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: We propose a grading and staging system that reflects the unique histological features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "2     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been associated with the insulin-resistance syndrome, at present defined as the metabolic syndrome, whose limits were recently set. We assessed the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in 304 consecutive NAFLD patients without overt diabetes, on the basis of 3 or more criteria out of 5 defined by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (waist circumference, glucose, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]-cholesterol, triglycerides, and arterial pressure). The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome increased with increasing body mass index, from 18% in normal-weight subjects to 67% in obesity. Insulin resistance (Homeostasis Model Assessment method) was significantly associated with the metabolic syndrome (odds ratio [OR], 2.5; 95% CI, 1.5-4.2; P < .001). Liver biopsy was available in 163 cases (54%). A total of 120 patients (73.6%) were classified as having nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH); 88% of them had a metabolic syndrome (vs. 53% of patients with pure fatty liver; P < .0001). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that the presence of metabolic syndrome carried a high risk of NASH among NAFLD subjects (OR, 3.2; 95% CI, 1.2-8.9; P = .026) after correction for sex, age, and body mass. In particular, the syndrome was associated with a high risk of severe fibrosis (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-11.2; P = .032). In conclusion, the presence of multiple metabolic disorders is associated with a potentially progressive, severe liver disease. The increasing prevalence of obesity, coupled with diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and ultimately the metabolic syndrome puts a very large population at risk of forthcoming liver failure in the next decades.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "3     Fatty liver disease that develops in the absence of alcohol abuse is recognized increasingly as a major health burden. This report summarizes the presentations and discussions at a Single Topic Conference held September 20-22, 2002, and sponsored by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. The conference focused on fatty liver disorders. Estimates based on imaging and autopsy studies suggest that about 20% to 30% of adults in the United States and other Western countries have excess fat accumulation in the liver. About 10% of these individuals, or fully 2% to 3% of adults, are estimated to meet current diagnostic criteria for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Sustained liver injury leads to progressive fibrosis and cirrhosis in a fraction, possibly up to one third, of those with NASH, and NASH may be a cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. NASH is now a significant health issue for obese children as well, leading to cirrhosis in some. The diagnostic criteria for NASH continue to evolve and rely on the histologic findings of steatosis, hepatocellular injury (ballooning, Mallory bodies), and the pattern of fibrosis. Generally recognized indications for biopsy include establishing the diagnosis and staging of the injury, but strict guidelines do not exist. Liver enzymes are insensitive and cannot be used reliably to confirm the diagnosis or stage the extent of fibrosis. Older age, obesity, and diabetes are predictive of fibrosis. The pathogenesis of NASH is multifactorial. Insulin resistance may be an important factor in the accumulation of hepatocellular fat, whereas excess intracellular fatty acids, oxidant stress, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion, and mitochondrial dysfunction may be important causes of hepatocellular injury in the steatotic liver. Efforts are underway to refine the role of insulin resistance in NASH and determine whether improving insulin sensitivity pharmacologically is an effective treatment. An altered lifestyle may be a more effective means of improving insulin sensitivity. The research agenda for the future includes establishing the role of insulin resistance and abnormal lipoprotein metabolism in NASH, determining the pathogenesis of cellular injury, defining predisposing genetic abnormalities, identifying better noninvasive predictors of disease, and defining effective therapy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "4     Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the lynchpin between steatosis and cirrhosis in the spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disorders (NAFLD), was barely recognized in 1981. NAFLD is now present in 17% to 33% of Americans, has a worldwide distribution, and parallels the frequency of central adiposity, obesity, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. NASH could be present in one third of NAFLD cases. Age, activity of steatohepatitis, and established fibrosis predispose to cirrhosis, which has a 7- to 10-year liver-related mortality of 12% to 25%. Many cases of cryptogenic cirrhosis are likely endstage NASH. While endstage NAFLD currently accounts for 4% to 10% of liver transplants, this may soon rise. Pathogenic concepts for NAFLD/NASH must account for the strong links with overnutrition and underactivity, insulin resistance, and genetic factors. Lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, cytokines, and other proinflammatory mediators may each play a role in transition of steatosis to NASH. The present \"gold standard\" management of NASH is modest weight reduction, particularly correction of central obesity achieved by combining dietary measures with increased physical activity. Whether achieved by \"lifestyle adjustment\" or anti-obesity surgery, this improves insulin resistance and reverses steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. The same potential for \"unwinding\" fibrotic NASH is indicated by studies of the peroxisome proliferation activator receptor (PPAR)-γ agonist \"glitazones,\" but these agents may improve liver disease at the expense of worsening obesity. Future challenges are to approach NAFLD as a preventive public health initiative and to motivate affected persons to adopt a healthier lifestyle.

       "5     Background and Aims: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that NASH is associated with 2 defects: (1) peripheral insulin resistance, which increases lipolysis, delivery of free fatty acids (FFA) to the liver, and hepatic fatty acid β oxidation, thereby creating oxidative stress; and (2) an abnormality within the hepatocytes that might render them more susceptible to injury from oxidative stress. Methods: The hypothesis was tested by evaluation of (1) insulin resistance by a 2-step hyperinsulinemic (10 and 40 mU · m-2 · min-1) euglycemic clamp; (2) insulin effects on lipolysis by enrichment of [U-13C]glycerol; (3) frequency and severity of structural defects in hepatocyte mitochondria in vivo; (4) fatty acid β oxidation from serum [β-OH butyrate], release of water-soluble radioactivity from 3H-palmitate by cultured fibroblasts and urinary dicarboxylic acid excretion; and (5) hepatic lipid peroxidation by immunohistochemical staining for 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT). Subjects with NASH (n = 6-10 for different studies) were compared with those with fatty liver (n = 6) or normal controls (n = 6). Results: NASH and fatty liver were both associated with insulin resistance, with mean glucose infusion rates (normal/fatty liver/NASH) of step 1, 4.5/1.6/0.9; step 2, 9.5/7.7/4.5 (P &lt; 0.03 for both steps). Although baseline rates of glycerol appearance were higher in those with NASH than in those with fatty liver (means, 14.6 vs. 21.6 μmol · kg-1 · min-1; P &lt; 0.05), neither group significantly suppressed glycerol appearance at insulin infusion rates of 10 mU · m-2 · min-1. NASH was associated with loss of mitochondrial cristae and paracrystalline inclusions in 9 of 10 subjects, compared with 0 of 6 subjects with fatty liver. However, no evidence of a generalized defect in fatty acid β oxidation was noted in any group. Also, mean [β-OH butyrate] was highest in those with NASH (means, 90 vs. 110 vs. 160 μmol/L; P &lt; 0.04). Increased staining for 3-NT was present in fatty liver, and even greater staining was seen in NASH. Conclusions: These data indicate that peripheral insulin resistance, increased fatty acid β oxidation, and hepatic oxidative stress are present in both fatty liver and NASH, but NASH alone is associated with mitochondrial structural defects. © 2001 American Gastroenterological Association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "6     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes in patients of developed countries. We determined the long-term clinical and histological courses of such patients. In a cohort study, 129 consecutively enrolled patients diagnosed with biopsy-proven NAFLD were reevaluated. Survival and causes of death were compared with a matched reference population. Living NAFLD patients were offered repeat liver biopsy and clinical and biochemical investigation. Mean follow-up (SD) was 13.7 (1.3) years. Mortality was not increased in patients with steatosis. Survival of patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was reduced (P = .01). These subjects more often died from cardiovascular (P = .04) and liver-related (P = .04) causes. Seven patients (5.4%) developed end-stage liver disease, including 3 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. The absence of periportal fibrosis at baseline had a negative predictive value of 100% in predicting liver-related complications. At follow-up, 69 of 88 patients had diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance. Progression of liver fibrosis occurred in 41%. These subjects more often had a weight gain exceeding 5 kg (P = .02), they were more insulin resistant (P = .04), and they exhibited more pronounced hepatic fatty infiltration (P = .03) at follow-up. In conclusion, NAFLD with elevated liver enzymes is associated with a clinically significant risk of developing end-stage liver disease. Survival is lower in patients with NASH. Most NAFLD patients will develop diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance in the long term. Progression of liver fibrosis is associated with more pronounced insulin resistance and significant weight gain.

       "7     Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may present with increased hepatic fibrosis progressing to end-stage liver disease. No factors that determine increasing fibrosis and histologically advanced disease have been recognized, thus, liver biopsy is recommended in all patients for diagnosis and prognosis. Our aim was to identify independent predictors of severe hepatic fibrosis in patients with NASH. One hundred and forty-four patients were studied. All patients underwent liver biopsy. Clinical and biochemical variables were examined with univariate and multivariate analysis. Thirty- seven (26%) patients had no abnormal fibrosis, 53 (37%) had mild fibrosis, 15 (10%) had moderate fibrosis, 14 (10%) had bridging fibrosis, and 25 (17%) had cirrhosis. In multivariate analysis, older age (P = .001), obesity (P = .002), diabetes mellitus (P = .009), and aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase (AST/ALT) ratio greater than 1 (P = .03) were significant predictors of severe liver fibrosis (bridging/cirrhosis). Body mass index (P = .003) was the only independent predictor of the degree of fat infiltration. Increased transferrin saturation correlated positively with the severity of fibrosis (P = .02) in univariate analysis, and there was a trend for more female patients among those with more advanced fibrosis (P = .09). However, iron studies or gender were not significant when controlled for age, obesity, diabetes, and AST/ALT ratio. In conclusion, older age, obesity, and presence of diabetes mellitus help identify those NASH patients who might have severe liver fibrosis. This is the subgroup of patients with NASH who would be expected to derive the most benefit from having a liver biopsy and considering investigational therapies.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "8     Background Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease, and its worldwide prevalence continues to increase with the growing obesity epidemic. This study assesses the epidemiology of NAFLD in adults based on clinical literature published over the past 30 years. Aim To review epidemiology and natural history of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis in adults based on clinical literature published over the past 30 years. Methods An in-depth search of PubMed (1980-2010) was based on five search terms: 'non-alcoholic fatty liver disease' OR 'non-alcoholic steatohepatitis' OR 'fatty liver' OR 'steatosis' AND 'incidence' [MeSH Terms] OR 'prevalence' [MeSH Terms] OR 'natural history'. Studies of paediatric cohorts were excluded. Articles were categorised by topic and summarised, noting generalisations concerning their content. Results Four study categories included NAFLD incidence, prevalence, risk factors and natural history. Studies related to NAFLD prevalence and incidence indicate that the diagnosis is heterogeneous and relies on a variety of assessment tools, including liver biopsy, radiological tests such as ultrasonography, and blood testing such as liver enzymes. The prevalence of NAFLD is highest in populations with pre-existing metabolic conditions such as obesity and type II diabetes. Many studies investigating the natural history of NAFLD verify the progression from NASH to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Conclusions Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common cause of elevated liver enzymes. Within the NAFLD spectrum, only NASH progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. With the growing epidemic of obesity, the prevalence and impact of NAFLD continues to increase, making NASH potentially the most common cause of advanced liver disease in coming decades. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "9     Background & Aims: This prospective study evaluates the role of radiological modalities in establishing the diagnosis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: Consecutive patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were enrolled (2000-2001). Patients with other liver diseases and significant alcohol consumption (>20 g/day) were excluded. Clinicodemographic data were gathered at the time of liver biopsy. Each biopsy specimen was assessed by a hepatopathologist. Each patient underwent a limited abdominal ultrasonography (US), computerized tomography (CT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Films were interpreted by a radiologist who used a predetermined radiological protocol. Each radiological study was reread by the same radiologist and a second radiologist. Results: Patients with NASH had greater aspartate aminotransferase levels (P = 0.03), greater ferritin levels (P = 0.05), more hepatocyte ballooning (P < 0.0001), and more fibrosis (P = 0.002). None of the radiological features distinguished between NASH and other types of NAFLD. No radiological modality detected the presence of hepatocyte ballooning, Mallory's hyaline, or fibrosis, which are important features in the diagnosis of NASH. The presence of >33% fat on liver biopsy was optimal for detecting steatosis on radiological imaging. Conclusions: Differences between NASH and nonprogressive NAFLD were not apparent with any radiological modality. Of the pathologic features important for establishing the diagnosis of NASH, only the severity of steatosis was reflected in these radiological modalities. Good intraobserver agreement was evident for each modality (US, CT, and MRI) that was superior to interobserver agreement.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "10    Background & Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may progress to cirrhosis; whether NASH plays also a role in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is unknown. Methods: Among 641 cirrhosis-associated HCCs, we retrospectively identified 44 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC). Of these, 23 were actively followed up and were compared in a case-control study with viral- and alcohol-associated HCC. Family and personal history of diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, dyslipidemia, obesity, and biochemical data were compared between groups. Iron status and presence of mutations in the HFE gene of familiar hemochromatosis were also determined. Results: Family history was not different in relation to etiology. The prevalence of obesity and diabetes was significantly higher in patients with CC. Although liver function was similar, CC patients had higher glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride plasma levels, increased parameters of insulin resistance, and lower aminotransferase levels. Iron status and prevalence of mutations in the HFE gene did not differ. Logistic regression analysis identified in sequence hypertriglyceridemia, diabetes, and normal aminotransferases as independent factors associated with HCC arising in CC. Conclusions: Features suggestive of NASH are more frequently observed in HCC arising in patients with CC than in age- and sex-matched HCC patients of well-defined viral or alcoholic etiology. HCC may represent a late complication of NASH-related cirrhosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "11    Background & Aims: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common in severely obese subjects and can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. Predicting advanced or progressive disease may help in selecting patients for liver biopsy and assist the development of therapeutic options. Methods: Liver biopsies were taken at laparoscopic obesity surgery in 105 consecutive patients. The clinical and biochemical variables were analyzed for correlation with specific histologic features. Results: Twenty-six patients (25%) were found to have nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and 11 (42%) of these had advanced fibrosis. A raised index of insulin resistance (odds ratio [OR] 9.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.4-26), systemic hypertension (OR 5.2, 95% Cl 2.0-13.5), and raised alanine aminotransferase (OR 8.6, 95% Cl 3.1-23.5) were independent predictors of NASH. A combination of 2 or 3 of these predictors allows a sensitivity of 0.8 and specificity of 0.89 for NASH. Alcohol consumption was associated with a reduction in NASH (OR 0.35, 95% Cl 0.12-1.00) and diabetes (OR 0.18, 95% Cl 0.047-0.67). Conclusion: Insulin resistance and systemic hypertension, features of the metabolic syndrome, are independently associated with advanced forms of NAFLD. Moderate alcohol consumption seems to reduce the risk of NAFLD in the severely obese, possibly by reducing insulin resistance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "12    Background & Aims: In nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the distinction between steatosis and steatohepatitis (NASH) and the assessment of the severity of the disease rely on liver histology alone. The aim of this study was to assess the sampling error of liver biopsy and its impact on the diagnosis and staging of NASH. Methods: Fifty-one patients with NAFLD underwent percutaneous liver biopsy with 2 samples collected. The agreement between paired biopsy specimens was assessed by the percentage of discordant results and by the κ reliability test. Results: No features displayed high agreement; substantial agreement was only seen for steatosis grade; moderate agreement for hepatocyte ballooning and perisinusoidal fibrosis; fair agreement for Mallory bodies; acidophilic bodies and lobular inflammation displayed only slight agreement. Overall, the discordance rate for the presence of hepatocyte ballooning was 18%, and ballooning would have been missed in 24% of patients had only 1 biopsy been performed. The negative predictive value of a single biopsy for the diagnosis of NASH was at best 0.74. Discordance of 1 stage or more was 41%. Six of 17 patients with bridging fibrosis (35%) on 1 sample had only mild or no fibrosis on the other and therefore could have been under staged with only 1 biopsy. Intraobserver variability was systematically lower than sampling variability and therefore could not account for most of the sampling error. Conclusions: Histologic lesions of NASH are unevenly distributed throughout the liver parenchyma; therefore, sampling error of liver biopsy can result in substantial misdiagnosis and staging inaccuracies. © 2005 by the American Gastroenterological Association.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "13    Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome and the leading cause of chronic liver disease in the Western world. Twenty per cent of NAFLD individuals develop chronic hepatic inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) associated with cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet the causes of progression from NAFLD to NASH remain obscure. Here, we show that the NLRP6 and NLRP3 inflammasomes and the effector protein IL-18 negatively regulate NAFLD/NASH progression, as well as multiple aspects of metabolic syndrome via modulation of the gut microbiota. Different mouse models reveal that inflammasome-deficiency- associated changes in the configuration of the gut microbiota are associated with exacerbated hepatic steatosis and inflammation through influx of TLR4 and TLR9 agonists into the portal circulation, leading to enhanced hepatic tumour-necrosis factor (TNF)-α expression that drives NASH progression. Furthermore, co-housing of inflammasome-deficient mice with wild-type mice results in exacerbation of hepatic steatosis and obesity. Thus, altered interactions between the gut microbiota and the host, produced by defective NLRP3 and NLRP6 inflammasome sensing, may govern the rate of progression of multiple metabolic syndrome-associated abnormalities, highlighting the central role of the microbiota in the pathogenesis of heretofore seemingly unrelated systemic auto-inflammatory and metabolic disorders. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

       "14    Background &amp; Aims: Prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has not been well established. The purpose of this study was to prospectively define the prevalence of both NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Methods: Outpatients 18 to 70 years old were recruited from Brooke Army Medical Center. All patients completed a baseline questionnaire and ultrasound. If fatty liver was identified, then laboratory data and a liver biopsy were obtained. Results: Four hundred patients were enrolled. Three hundred and twenty-eight patients completed the questionnaire and ultrasound. Mean age (range, 28-70 years) was 54.6 years (7.35); 62.5% Caucasian, 22% Hispanic, and 11.3% African American; 50.9% female; mean body mass index (BMI) (calculated as kg/m2) was 29.8 (5.64); and diabetes and hypertension prevalence 16.5% and 49.7%, respectively. Prevalence of NAFLD was 46%. NASH was confirmed in 40 patients (12.2% of total cohort, 29.9% of ultrasound positive patients). Hispanics had the highest prevalence of NAFLD (58.3%), then Caucasians (44.4%) and African Americans (35.1%). NAFLD patients were more likely to be male (58.9%), older (P = .004), hypertensive (P &lt; .00005), and diabetic (P &lt; .00005). They had a higher BMI (P &lt; .0005), ate fast food more often (P = .049), and exercised less (P = 0.02) than their non-NAFLD counterparts. Hispanics had a higher prevalence of NASH compared with Caucasians (19.4% vs 9.8%; P = .03). Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, BMI, insulin, Quantitative Insulin-Sensitivity Check Index, and cytokeratin-18 correlated with NASH. Among the 54 diabetic patients, NAFLD was found in 74% and NASH in 22.2%. Conclusion: Prevalence of NAFLD and NASH is higher than estimated previously. Hispanics and patients with diabetes are at greatest risk for both NAFLD and NASH. © 2011 AGA Institute.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "15    Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is often linked with disorders that are clearly associated with insulin resistance (IR): obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertriglyceridemia. We tested the hypotheses that (1) IR is an essential requirement for the development of NASH and (2) a high association between IR and liver disease is relatively specific for NASH. We measured body mass index (BMI), waist/hip ratio, and fasting serum lipid, insulin, C-peptide, and glucose levels in 66 patients with NASH (21 with advanced fibrosis and 45 with mild fibrosis). IR was determined by the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). We also determined the strength of the association of NASH with insulin resistance syndrome (IRS) as defined by World Health Organization criteria. To assess whether the finding of IR was relatively specific to NASH rather than simply to obesity or liver disease, we compared the results of a subset of 36 patients with less-severe NASH with 36 age- and sex-matched patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) of comparable fibrotic severity. IR was confirmed in 65 patients (98%) with NASH, and 55 (87%) fulfilled minimum criteria for IRS. IR was found in lean as well as in overweight and obese patients. The IR values and the prevalence of IRS (75% vs. 8.3%) were significantly higher in those with NASH than in comparable cases of HCV. Hyperinsulinemia was attributable to increased insulin secretion rather than decreased hepatic extraction. In conclusion, most patients with NASH have IRS, and there is a near-universal association between NASH and IR irrespective of obesity. IR is present in mild as well as advanced cases of NASH but is unusual in chronic HCV of similar fibrotic severity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "16    This review addresses recent advances in specific mechanisms of hepatotoxicity. Because of its unique metabolism and relationship to the gastrointestinal tract, the liver is an important target of the toxicity of drugs, xenobiotics, and oxidative stress. In cholestatic disease, endogenously generated bile acids produce hepatocellular apoptosis by stimulating Fas translocation from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane where self-aggregation occurs to trigger apoptosis. Kupffer cell activation and neutrophil infiltration extend toxic injury. Kupffer cells release reactive oxygen species (ROS), cytokines, and chemokines, which induce neutrophil extravasation and activation. The liver expresses many cytochrome P450 isoforms, including ethanol-induced CYP2E1. CYP2E1 generates ROS, activates many toxicologically important substrates, and may be the central pathway by which ethanol causes oxidative stress. In acetaminophen toxicity, nitric oxide (NO) scavenges superoxide to produce peroxynitrite, which then causes protein nitration and tissue injury. In inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) knockout mice, nitration is prevented, but unscavenged superoxide production then causes toxic lipid peroxidation to occur instead. Microvesicular steatosis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and cytolytic hepatitis involve mitochondrial dysfunction, including impairment of mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, and damage to mitochondrial DNA. Induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is another mechanism causing mitochondrial failure, which can lead to necrosis from ATP depletion or caspase-dependent apoptosis if ATP depletion does not occur fully. Because of such diverse mechanisms, hepatotoxicity remains a major reason for drug withdrawal from pharmaceutical development and clinical use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "17    We characterized 70 consecutive patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis to assess major risks for liver disease. Each patient was reevaluated for past alcohol exposure, scored by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis (IAH) score and assessed for viral hepatitis risks and risks for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The results were compared with 50 consecutive NASH patients, 39 nonalcoholic patients age 50 and over with cirrhosis from hepatitis C, and 33 consecutive patients with cirrhosis caused by primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). Among the cryptogenic group, 49 (70%) were female, and the mean age was 63 ± 11 years. Although ascites and variceal bleeding were common, almost one half lacked major signs of complicated portal hypertension. A history of Type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or obesity was present in 51 (73%). Nineteen (27%) patients had a history of blood transfusions antedating the diagnosis of cirrhosis. No clinical or histological features distinguished this group from the other patients, and 14 (74%) of these had a history of obesity and/or diabetes. Nineteen of the remaining nontransfused patients had indeterminant IAH scores but were histologically and biochemically indistinguishable from the others. Twelve of these (63%) also had a history of obesity and/or diabetes. Both diabetes and obesity were significantly more common in the cryptogenic cirrhotic patients compared with the cirrhotic patients with PBC or hepatitis C. In contrast, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes was similar to the NASH patients who were, on average, a decade younger. Although there is some diversity that indicates more than one cause, our findings suggest that NASH plays an under- recognized role in many patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, most of whom are older, type 2 diabetic and obese females.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "18    Whereas in most cases a fatty liver remains free of inflammation, 10%-20% of patients who have fatty liver develop inflammation and fibrosis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]). Inflammation may precede steatosis in certain instances. Therefore, NASH could reflect a disease where inflammation is followed by steatosis. In contrast, NASH subsequent to simple steatosis may be the consequence of a failure of antilipotoxic protection. In both situations, many parallel hits derived from the gut and/or the adipose tissue may promote liver inflammation. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and related signaling networks, (adipo)cytokines, and innate immunity are emerging as central pathways that regulate key features of NASH. © 2010 American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "19    Adiponectin has antilipogenic and anti-inflammatory effects, while tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) reduces insulin sensitivity and has proinflammatory effects. We examined (1) the extent to which hypoadiponectinemia and TNF-α activation are features of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and (2) whether serum levels of these markers correlate with the severity of histological changes in 109 subjects with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including 80 with NASH and 29 with simple steatosis. By multivariate analysis, subjects with NASH had reduced adiponectin level and increased TNF-α and soluble TNF receptor 2 (sTNFR2)-but not leptin levels, compared with controls matched by age, sex, and body mass index; these differences were independent of the increased insulin resistance (by homeostasis model [HOMA-IR]) in NASH. When compared with simple steatosis, NASH was associated with lower adiponectin levels and higher HOMA-IR, but there were no significant differences in the levels of TNF-α and sTNFR2. The majority of subjects with steatohepatitis (77%) had adiponectin levels less than 10 μg/mL and HOMA-IR greater than 3 units, but only 33% of those with pure steatosis had these findings. HOMA-IR and low serum adiponectin were also independently associated with increased grades of hepatic necroinflammation. In conclusion, hypoadiponectinemia is a feature of NASH independent of insulin resistance. Reduced adiponectin level is associated with more extensive necroinflammation and may contribute to the development of necroinflammatory forms of NAFLD.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "20    Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a common and deadly malignancy that is increasing in incidence in developed countries. The emergence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) accounts for about half of this increase in HCC, although the etiology of HCC in 15%-50% of new HCC cases remains unclear. The most common form of chronic liver disease in developed countries is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), which encompasses a broad spectrum of histopathology. The prevalence of NAFLD, including the more aggressive nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is increasing with the growing epidemics of diabetes and obesity. NASH can progress to cirrhosis and its related complications. Growing evidence suggests that NASH accounts for a large proportion of idiopathic or cryptogenic cirrhosis, which is associated with the typical risk factors for NASH. HCC is a rare, although important complication of NAFLD. Diabetes and obesity have been established as independent risk factors for the development of HCC. New evidence also suggests that hepatic iron deposition increases the risk of HCC in NASH-derived cirrhosis. Multiple case reports and case reviews of HCC in the setting of NASH support the associations of diabetes and obesity with the risk of HCC, as well as suggest age and advanced fibrosis as significant risks. Insulin resistance and its subsequent inflammatory cascade that is associated with the development of NASH appear to play a significant role in the carcinogenesis of HCC. The complications of NASH, including cirrhosis and HCC, are expected to increase with the growing epidemic of diabetes and obesity.

       "21    Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a significant form of chronic liver disease in adults and children. The natural history of NASH ranges from indolent to end-stage liver disease. Current studies are focusing on identification of histologic and/or clinical markers of progression. NASH may be an underlying cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis, and the lesions of NASH may recur in allograft livers. An expanding array of clinical conditions and pathogenetic mechanisms have been identified, but many cases remain \"idiopathic\"; lack of significant alcohol use is, by definition, common to all cases. Neither clinical evaluation nor laboratory values can ensure either the diagnosis or the exclusion of NASH, and liver biopsy interpretation continues to be considered the \"gold standard\" for diagnosis. The lesions in NASH are similar but not identical to those of alcoholic steatohepatitis; exact, specific histologic criteria for the diagnosis are currently under discussion. The lesions most commonly accepted for NASH include steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning degeneration, mild diffuse lobular mixed acute and chronic inflammation, and perivenular, perisinusoidal collagen deposition. Zone 3 accentuation may be detected. Mallory's hyaline, vacuolated nuclei in periportal hepatocytes, lobular lipogranulomas, and PAS-diastase-resistant Kupffer cells are common. In biopsy specimens from children, portal inflammation may be more prominent than in adults. Progression of fibrosis may result in bridging septa and cirrhosis. The lesions of steatohepatitis may be noted concurrently with other forms of chronic liver disease. A histological \"grading and staging\" system has been developed to reflect the unique features of steatohepatitis, gradations of severity and fibrosis, and to promote uniform reporting of the histopathology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "22    Insulin resistance (IR) commonly is associated with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To establish whether IR causes NASH, this study was undertaken to determine if improving IR would improve the histologic features that define NASH. Thirty adults with prior biopsy evidence of NASH were enrolled to receive rosiglitazone, 4 mg twice daily for 48 weeks. All patients were overweight (body mass index [BMI] &gt; 25 kg/m2) and 23% were severely obese (BMI &gt; 35 kg/m2); 50% had impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes. Liver biopsy specimens were obtained before beginning treatment and at treatment completion. Twenty-six patients had posttreatment biopsies; of these, 22 had initial protocol liver biopsies that met published criteria for NASH on subsequent blinded evaluation. Within this initial NASH group, the mean global necroinflammatory score significantly improved with treatment and biopsies of 10 patients (45%) no longer met published criteria for NASH after treatment. Significant improvement in hepatocellular ballooning and zone 3 perisinusoidal fibrosis also occurred. Five patients withdrew early; the 25 patients completing 48 weeks of treatment had significantly improved insulin sensitivity and mean serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (104 initially, 42 U/L at the end of treatment). Adverse effects led to withdrawal of 3 patients (10%). Weight gain occurred in 67% of patients and the median weight increase was 7.3%. Within 6 months of completing treatment, liver enzyme levels had increased to near pre-treatment levels. In conclusion, improving insulin sensitivity with rosiglitazone resulted in improved histologic markers of NASH, an observation suggesting that insulin resistance contributes to its development and that improving insulin sensitivity may be important in treating this liver disease.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "23    Background & Aims: The pathogenesis of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) remains poorly understood. Although apoptosis is a common mechanism of liver injury, the extent and clinical significance of apoptosis in NASH has not been examined. Thus, the aims of this study were to quantify hepatocyte apoptosis in NASH, correlate it with disease severity, and identify possible mechanisms of apoptosis induction. Methods: Hepatocyte apoptosis was assessed in NASH, simple steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis, and controls without liver disease using the TUNEL assay and immunohistochemistry for activated caspases 3 and 7. Liver specimens were also graded according to the magnitude of inflammation and fibrosis. Results: TUNEL-positive cells were significantly increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with NASH compared with simple steatosis and controls. Unexpectedly, TUNEL-positive cells were also greater in NASH vs. alcoholic hepatitis. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated active caspases 3 and 7 in NASH specimens, confirming the occurrence of apoptosis in this disease. A positive correlation was observed between hepatocyte apoptosis and hepatic fibrosis and inflammatory activity, respectively. The Fas receptor was strongly expressed in hepatocytes in liver specimens from NASH patients as compared with controls. Conclusions: Hepatocyte apoptosis is significantly increased in patients with NASH and correlates with disease severity, suggesting that antiapoptotic therapy may be useful in this syndrome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "24    Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a common chronic liver disease for which there is no known effective therapy. A proportion of patients with NASH progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH is considered one of the clinical features of the metabolic syndrome in which insulin resistance plays a central role. This prospective study evaluates the role of insulin-sensitizing agent in treatment of NASH. Eighteen nondiabetic patients with biopsy-proven NASH were treated with pioglitazone (30 mg daily) for 48 weeks. Tests of insulin sensitivity and body composition as well as liver biopsies were performed before and at the end of treatment. By 48 weeks, serum alanine aminotransferase values fell to normal in 72% of patients. Hepatic fat content and size as determined by magnetic resonance imaging decreased, and glucose and free fatty acid sensitivity to insulin were uniformly improved. Histological features of steatosis, cellular injury, parenchymal inflammation, Mallory bodies, and fibrosis were significantly improved from baseline (all P < 0.05). Using strict criteria, histological improvement occurred in two-thirds of patients. Pioglitazone was well tolerated; the main side effects were weight gain (averaging 4%) and an increase in total body adiposity. In conclusion, these results indicate that treatment with an insulin-sensitizing agent can lead to improvement in biochemical and histological features of NASH and support the role of insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. The long-term safety and benefits of pioglitazone require further study.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "25    Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and alcoholic liver disease have similar pathological features. Because CYP2E1 plays a key role in alcoholic liver disease with its ability to stimulate lipid peroxidation, we tested the proposal that CYP2E1 could also be a factor in the development of NASH. In a dietary model - mice fed a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet - liver injury was associated with both induction of CYP2E1 and a 100-fold increase in hepatic content of lipid peroxides. Microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid oxidases contributed to the formation of these lipid peroxides, and in vitro inhibition studies demonstrated that CYP2E1 was the major catalyst. To further define the role of CYP2E1 as an initiator of oxidative stress in NASH, Cyp2e1-/-mice were administered the MCD diet. CYP2E1 deficiency neither prevented the development of NASH nor abrogated the increased microsomal NADPH-dependent lipid peroxidation, indicating the operation of a non-CYP2E1 peroxidase pathway. In Cyp2e1-/- mice with NASH (but not in wild-type mice), CYP4A10 and CYP4A14 were upregulated. Furthermore, hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation was substantially inhibited by anti-mouse CYP4A10 antibody in vitro. These results show that experimental NASH is strongly associated with hepatic microsomal lipid peroxidation. CYP2E1, the main enzyme associated with that process in wild-type mice, is not unique among P450 proteins in catalyzing peroxidation of endogenous lipids. We have now identified CYP4A enzymes as alternative initiators of oxidative stress in the liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "26    The definable causes of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) include jejunoileal bypass surgery (JIB), other causes of rapid and profound weight loss in obese subjects, total parenteral nutrition, drugs, industrial toxins, copper toxicity, and disorders characterized by extreme insulin resistance. However, the etiopathogenesis in most cases of NASH appears multifactorial. Obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia are often associated with hepatic steatosis, and although this does not invariably lead to NASH, the fatty liver is vulnerable to hepatocellular injury initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is critical to understand not only the triggers for hepatitis (injury and inflammation) in NASH but also how this is perpetuated as chronic liver disease. The present focus is on whether the biochemical processes that generate oxidative stress lead to hepatocyte injury and secondary recruitment of inflammation or whether inflammation is the primary mediator of liver cell injury. Insulin resistance is a reproducible pathogenic factor in NASH. It favors accumulation of free fatty acids in the liver and predisposes to oxidative stress by stimulating microsomal lipid peroxidases and by the direct effects of high insulin levels in decreasing mitochondrial β-oxidation. CYP2E1 is normally suppressed by insulin but is invariably increased in the livers of patients with NASH. In rodent dietary models of steatohepatitis, CYP2E1 is the catalyst of microsomal lipid peroxidation, while in Cyp 2e1 nullizygous mice, CYP4A proteins are induced and function as alternative microsomal lipid peroxidases. Other studies implicate activation of peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor-α (PPARα) as leading to NASH; PPARα is a transcription factor that governs both microsomal (via CYP4A) and peroxisomal (β-oxidation) pathways of lipid oxidation and ultimately production of ROS. Increased lipid peroxidation is a crucial difference between the livers of rodents with experimental NASH and those of ob/ob genetically obese mice that have uncomplicated steatosis. Administration of endotoxin, through the release of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), provokes liver inflammation with hepatocyte injury in the steatotic liver. This may be particularly relevant in JIB and has been suggested as a pathogenic mechanism in primary NASH. It has been proposed that inheriting one or more copies of the hemochromatosis gene, C282Y, promotes fibrotic progression in NASH because of increased hepatic iron deposition, but recent studies have failed to confirm this. The relationship between the severity of hepatitis in NASH and progression to cirrhosis implies that products of the inflammatory infiltrate play a role in fibrogenesis. In summary, NASH can be regarded as the hepatic consequence of the metabolic syndrome (or syndrome X). Attention should now shift from steatosis, a generally benign process that is less evident in the advanced stages of cirrhosis, to the mechanisms for hepatocellular injury, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. In particular, the genetic, molecular, and cellular factors that ordain and moderate fibrosis in the context of steatohepatitis will be of greatest relevance to effective therapy and clinical outcome.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "27    Background and Aims: Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a chronic liver disease that occasionally progresses to cirrhosis but usually has a benign course. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the hemochromatosis mutation Cys282Tyr in development of the mild hepatic iron overload found in some patients with NASH and its association with hepatic damage in these patients. Methods: Fifty-one patients with NASH were studied. The presence of the Cys282Tyr mutation was tested in all patients, and the data were analyzed with respect to the histological grade of steatosis, inflammation, Perls' staining, hepatic iron concentration (HIC), and serum iron indices. Results: Thirty-one percent of patients with NASH were either homozygous or heterozygous for the Cys282Tyr mutation. This mutation was significantly associated with Perls' stain grade (P < 0.005), HIC (P < 0.005), and transferrin saturation percentage (P < 0.005) but not with serum ferritin levels. Linear regression analysis showed that increased hepatic iron (Perls' stain or HIC) had the greatest association with the severity of fibrosis (P < 0.0001). Conclusions: The Cys282Tyr mutation is responsible for most of the mild iron overload found in NASH and thus has a significant association with hepatic damage in these patients. Heterozygosity for the hemochromatosis gene mutation therefore cannot always be considered benign.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "28    This study aims to determine the presence of the components of the metabolic syndrome in primary nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to assess the role of liver disease in the genesis of peripheral hyperinsulinemia. Nineteen patients (18 men and 1 woman; mean age, ± SD, 38 ± 10 years; body mass index [BMI], 26 ± 2 kg/m2) with histologic evidence of NASH were enrolled; 19 age- and sex-matched normal subjects were investigated as controls. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide levels were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test, and a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT), analyzed by minimal modeling technique, was performed. Compared with controls, the NASH group had lower insulin sensitivity (3.84 ± 2.44 vs. 7.48 ± 3.01 10-4 × min-1/μU/mL; P =.0003) and higher total insulin secretion (21 ± 13 vs. 10 ± 3 nmol/L in 240 minutes; P =.001). Hepatic insulin extraction was similar in both groups (69.8% ± 16.1% vs. 70.2% ± 18.3%; P =.854). According to the results of the oral glucose tolerance test, no patient was classified as diabetic, 5 were classified as glucose intolerant, and 1 was classified as having impaired fasting glycemia. Nine patients (47%) had at least the 2 minimum criteria required to define the metabolic syndrome according to the European Group for the Study of Insulin Resistance (EGIR). In conclusion, hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance occur frequently in patients with NASH; these conditions do not stem from a reduced hepatic insulin extraction but from an enhanced pancreatic insulin secretion compensatory to reduced insulin sensitivity. The derangement of insulin regulation, often associated with the metabolic syndrome, may play a causal role in the pathogenesis of NASH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "29    Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease that has been shown to progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. This article reviews the prevalence of NAFLD and the factors associated this disorder, and with the more advanced stages of NAFLD, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. In the general population, the estimated prevalence ranges from 3% to 24%, with most estimates in the 6% to 14% range. NAFLD is extremely common among patients undergoing bariatric surgery, ranging from 84% to 96%. In these patients, 25% to 55% have NASH, 34% to 47% have fibrosis, and 2% to 12% have bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis. NAFLD appears to be most strongly associated with obesity, and insulin resistance states including diabetes and with other features of the metabolic syndrome, such as high triglycerides and low HDL. It appears to be more common in men, and it increases with increasing age and after menopause. Some data suggest that Mexican Americans are more likely to have NAFLD and blacks are less likely compared with non-Hispanic whites. More advanced stages of NAFLD are associated with older age, higher body mass index, diabetes, hypertension, high triglycerides, and/or insulin resistance. An AST/ALT ratio greater >1 may also indicate more severe disease. Although hepatocellular carcinoma can occur in the setting of NAFLD, the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma in the setting of NAFLD have not been established. More prospective studies are needed to determine the true risk factors for the development and progression of NAFLD to help identify patients at highest risk who might benefit from treatment trials.

       "1969  The favorable metabolic effects of telmisartan have been attributed to its angiotensin II receptor blockade and action as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-γ. We previously reported that administration of telmisartan markedly inhibited lipid accumulation in the liver in mice fed a high-fat diet. In the present study, we further examined the protective effect of telmisartan in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model induced by feeding Wistar rats an L-methionine- and choline-deficient (MCA) diet. In the first experiment, rats were fed an MCA diet for 8 weeks with or without telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day). Liver fibrosis was observed by Masson trichrome staining, and co-treatment was shown to attenuate liver fibrosis. In the second experiment, Wistar rats were fed an MCA diet for 20 weeks, and telmisartan (3 mg/kg/day) was administered during weeks 0-20 as a preventive model or weeks 8-20 as a therapeutic model. As a result, telmisartan administration in both models significantly attenuated liver fibrosis and an increase in serum AST. Of importance, the HGF concentration in the liver was significantly increased in the telmisartan-treated group. Overall, telmisartan showed a potential action to improve NASH induced by an MCA diet, possibly due to increased HGF production through partial agonist of PPAR-γ. These favorable characteristics of telmisartan as a partial agonist of PPAR-γ may provide a benefit in the treatment of metabolic syndrome beyond its blood pressure-lowering effect.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1970  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a clinico-pathologic spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Although simple or bland steatosis follows a relatively benign clinical course, NASH can potentially progress to cirrhosis (approximately 10 to 15 percent) and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD occurs in an estimated 25 to 30 percent of the US general population, while NASH is reported in 2 to 3 percent of the population. Even though common explanation for the increased prevalence of NAFLD is the increased rate of obesity, the risk of developing NAFLD and NASH is not limited to overweight and obese individuals. Currently, the only way to diagnose NASH or to assess the stage of fibrosis is by obtaining a liver biopsy. Liver biopsy is invasive, expensive, and associated with potential risks, including post biopsy pain, bleeding, organ perforation, and even death; serious complications can occur in 0.3 percent of liver biopsies with 0.01 percent being fatal. This review examines the current strategies for development of the non-invasive techniques that will one day replace liver biopsy and serve as a non-invasive gold standard for the diagnosis and staging of NASH. © 2010 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "1971  Aims: Oxidative stress may play an important role in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Oleuropein, the active constituent of olive leaf, possesses anti-oxidant, hypoglycaemic, and hypolipidaemic activities. We aimed to investigate the preventive effects of olive leaf extract on hepatic fat accumulation in a rat model of NASH. Methods: Spontaneously hypertensive/NIH-corpulent rats were fed a diet of AIN-93G with or without olive leaf extract (500, 1000, 2000 mg/kg diet, and control; 5 rats each) for 23 weeks. Serological and histopathological findings, anti-oxidative activity, and the alteration of fatty acid synthesis in the liver were evaluated. Results: Histopathologically, a diet of AIN-93G containing more than 1000 mg/kg olive leaf extract had a preventive effect for the occurrence of NASH. Thioredoxin-1 expression in the liver was more evident in rats fed this diet, and 4-hydroxynonenal expression in the liver was less evident in these rats. There were no significant differences in the activities of hepatic carnitine palmitoyltransferase, fatty acid synthase, malic enzyme, and phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase among the groups.

       "1972  Objective: To evaluate the role oral administration of S-nitroso-N-acetylcysteine (SNAC), a NO donor drug, in the prevention and reversion of NASH in two different animal models. Methods: NASH was induced in male ob/ob mice by methionine-choline deficient (MCD) and high-fat (H) diets. Two animal groups received or not SNAC orally for four weeks since the beginning of the treatment. Two other groups were submitted to MCD and H diets for 60 days receiving SNAC only from the 31st to the 60th day. Results: SNAC administration inhibited the development of NASH in all groups, leading to a marked decrease in macro and microvacuolar steatosis and in hepatic lipid peroxidation in the MCD group. SNAC treatment reversed the development of NASH in animals treated for 60 days with MCD or H diets, which received SNAC only from the 31st to the 60th day. Conclusions: Oral administration of SNAC markedly inhibited and reversed NASH induced by MCD and H diets in ob/ob mice. © 2008 American College of Nutrition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1973  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become one of the most prevalent liver diseases in the Western world. NAFLD represents a wide spectrum of histologic subgroups, with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis as the most aggressive form. The risk of developing NAFLD is strongly associated with metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is a multiple-hit process resulting from hepatic fat deposition that is related to several conditions, including insulin resistance and central obesity. Additional hits, such as oxidative stress or adipocytokines produced by white adipose tissue, can further enhance liver damage leading to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis or fibrosis. Although NAFLD is often the primary liver disease of metabolic conditions, it can also exacerbate other liver diseases such as hepatitis C (HCV); indeed, more than 50% of patients with HCV have hepatic steatosis. Hepatic steatosis can be related to host factors (e.g., obesity, metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance) or to the genotype of virus (e.g., HCV genotype 3). Increasing evidence suggests that hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance and obesity in the setting of HCV have a negative impact on the efficacy of treatment and hepatic progression of fibrosis. © 2008 Future Drugs Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1974  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been increasingly recognized as the most common pathological conditions affecting the liver. In concert with the increase in Body Mass Index in developed countries that has occurred during the last decades, more and more individuals referred for evaluation of abnormal liver tests are found to have NAFLD. In most cases, the increase in fat within the liver is not associated with impaired liver structure or function in the long-term. However, liver steatosis should be considered to be a marker of the metabolic syndrome. A minority of patients with NAFLD develop liver cirrhosis but NAFLD is probably the most common underlying cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis. Patients with NAFLD have an increased cardiovascular mortality as well as increase in liver related complications compared with matched controls. The diagnostic evaluation of a patient with suspected NAFLD depends heavily on the setting. In whom and when a liver biopsy is indicated is controversial. An adequate history is of major importance and when alcohol is suspected to be a contributing factor to the liver steatosis, several biochemical and clinical parameters may differentiate alcoholic fatty liver and NAFLD. Unfortunately, no histological gold standard is available for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and there is still a significant diversity among pathologist concerning the minimal requirements for the term NASH. Management of patients with NAFLD should be aimed at fighting the metabolic risk factors such as visceral obesity, hyperglycemia, type II diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertriglyceridemia. DM has been shown to be a predictor of worsening of fibrosis. Successful lifestyle modification with increased exercise and decreased food intake is able to remove the accumulation of liver fat and can reverse insulin resistance. Unfortunately, there are no well-controlled, randomized trials of weight control as therapy for NAFLD. Some pharmacological pilot trials have been undertaken in NAFLD, but no proved treatment for all patients with NAFLD and/or NASH is available at the current time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1975  Objective. To investigate the incidence rate and causes of cirrhosis in a Norwegian population. We also sought to assess the degree of underreporting of cirrhosis to the Norwegian Death Registry. Material and methods. All 1264 patients treated at Aker University Hospital in the period January 1999 to March 2004 who were given a diagnosis indicating cirrhosis, chronic liver disease or symptoms possibly attributable to cirrhosis were screened retrospectively. A search of the registry of histological diagnoses at Department of Pathology was also carried out. Based on the results of histological examinations and non-histological criteria, cirrhosis was confirmed in 194 patients. Calculations of the incidence rate of cirrhosis and frequencies of the various etiologies were based on 93 patients living in the catchment area of the hospital. Causes of death were retrieved from the Norwegian Death Registry. Results. The incidence rate of cirrhosis was 134 per million per year. The majority of cases were due to alcoholic liver disease (53%), followed by viral liver disease (12%), various autoimmune liver diseases (12%), hemochromatosis (4%) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) (3%). No etiology was established in 16%, a group with a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus, indicating that some of these cases were possibly caused by NASH. Among 105 deaths in this cohort of 194 cirrhotic patients, the diagnosis of cirrhosis was absent in the Norwegian Death Registry in 30% of cases. Conclusions. The incidence of cirrhosis in Norway is relatively low, with alcohol as the most important etiologic factor. Significant underreporting to the Norwegian Death Registry was observed. © 2007 Taylor & Francis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1976  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most severe form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The aim of our study was to highlight NASH as a rare but possible problem in children. We present a case of 13-yr-boy with a well-established diagnosis of liver cirrhosis secondary to NASH, who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) at the age of 13 years. Six months after transplantation recurrence of NASH in the graft was diagnosed. In the treatment metformin was used with good effect. © 2007 Blackwell Munksgaard.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "1977  Obesity has emerged as a significant global health problem in the pediatric population. Pediatric liver disease is a serious complication of childhood obesity. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an entity in the spectrum of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) ranges from fat in the liver - simple steatosis, NASH/steatohepatitis - fat with in ammation and/or fibrosis to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis when fat may no longer be present. NASH is associated with obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance (IR), and hypertriglyceridemia. Children get NAFLD, and the incidence of this pediatric liver disease is rising as childhood obesity becomes increasingly prevalent. Although much remains to be learned about pediatric NAFLD, it is already evident that children with NASH risk progressive liver damage, including cirrhosis. Liver biopsy is required for definitive diagnosis, and other causes of fatty liver in childhood must be excluded. Gradual weight loss through increased regular exercise and a low-fat, low-refined carbohydrate diet appears to be effective. Drug treatments are being developed. The important message is that childhood obesity poses important health problems, including but not limited to potentially severe chronic liver disease. Early diagnosis of children who are only overweight is a worthy goal so that strategies to limit obesity can be instituted as early as possible. Identification of genetic risks is important, but management will invariably require changes in environmental factors. In addition to individual treatment, a multifaceted, societal initiative is required for solving the childhood obesity epidemic. © 2007 Dr. K C Chaudhuri Foundation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1978  Tamoxifen is a cheap and effective estrogen-receptor antagonist, used as the adjuvant hormonal treatment of choice in women with estrogen-receptor-positive breast cancer. Tamoxifen-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) may increase the demand on oncologists, not only with regard to screening for diabetes, but also for the suggested link of NASH with high incidence of coronary heart disease. At present, there is no guideline for treatment of hyperlipidaemia associated with tamoxifen-induced NASH. However, exemstane (and other aromatase inhibitors) has been shown to lower triglyceride and have a neutral effect on low-denisty lipoprotein and cholesterol levels. These may be alternative agents if severe progressive liver disease or hyperlipidaemia were encountered with tamoxifen administration. Other lipid-lowering medications may have potential benefits in the treatment of tamoxifen-induced NASH and is discussed in this article. © 2007 Informa UK Ltd.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",

       "1980  Objectives: Among numerous factors which account for the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic mitochondrial β-oxidation is considered to play a pivotal role. We performed a 13C-based breath test with a medium-chain fatty acid to non-invasively assess total body β-oxidation in patients with NASH and in healthy controls. Methods: We performed a simplified 13CO2-based breath test in 16 patients with histologically proven NASH and 24 healthy controls. One hundred milligrams of sodium 13C-octanoate dissolved in 200 ml of water were orally administered and breath samples were collected before and during 3 h following administration. The samples were analysed for the cumulative 13CO2 recovery (%-cum-dose) by non-dispersive infrared spectrometry. Additionally, data of 69 patients who had undergone a 13C-octanoate breath test for the assessment of gastric emptying were retrospectively evaluated for the %-cum-dose. Results: The cumulative 13CO2 recovery 3 h after the administration of the substrate did not differ among patients with NASH and controls (34.6 ± 7.0% vs. 34.6 ± 6.5%, P = 0.90). Compared with men, women yielded a significantly higher cumulative 13CO2 excretion in both controls (30.1 ± 5.7% vs. 38.5 ± 4.4%, P = 0.0008) and NASH patients (30.2 ± 5.4% vs. 39.0 ± 6.5%, P = 0.031). Forty-two of 69 patients (61%) of the gastric emptying group showed a normal gastric emptying rate. Among these patients, women also demonstrated a tendency for a higher 13CO2 recovery compared with men (P = 0.055). This was not the case in 27 patients with delayed gastric emptying (P = 0.47). Conclusions: Though hepatic mitochondrial function might be impaired in patients with NASH, total β-oxidation of octanoic acid remains normal. Gender-specific metabolic modifications seem to account for significant differences of the cumulative 13CO2 recovery in women and men. This may have further consequences for the appraisal of 13C breath tests which involve octanoic acid. Further trials focusing on the assessment of body composition and energy expenditure could contribute essential further information. © 2005 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1981  To explore the role of retinoic acid (RA) in liver, we developed transgenic mice expressing retinoic acid receptor α dominant negative form (RARE) in hepatocytes using by albumin promoter and enhancer. At 4 months of age, the RARE transgenic mice developed microvesicular steatosis and spotty focal necrosis. Mitochondrial β-oxidation activity of fatty acids and expression of its related enzymes including VLCAD, LCAD and HCD were down-regulated. On the other hand, peroxisomal β-oxidation and its related enzymes including AOX and BFE were up-regulated. Expression of CYP4a10, CYP4a12 and CYP4a14 was increased, suggesting that ω-oxidation of fatty acids in microsome was accelerated. In addition, formation of H2O2 and 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine was increased. After 12 months of age, these mice developed liver tumors which are hepatocellular carcinoma or adenoma. The incidence of tumor formation was increased with age. Expression of β-catenin and cyclin D1 was enhanced, and TCF-4/β-catenin complex was increased whereas RARα/β-catenin complex was decreased. Feeding on high RA diet reversed histological and biochemical abnormalities, and inhibited occurrence of liver tumor. Taken together, hepatic loss of RA function leads to development of steatohepatitis and liver tumor and RA plays an important role in preventing hepatocarcinogenesis in association with fatty acid metabolism and Wnt signaling. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

       "1982  Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition of increasing incidence in western Countries seldom associated to other diseases of high prevalence in general population (i.e. diabetes and obesity). NAFLD ranges from simple fatty liver to steatohepatitis (NASH), which may lead to cryptogenic cirrhosis and in some cases hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Natural history of NAFLD in humans is poorly understood and progression of liver disease seems to be due to interaction between hosting (i.e. genetic, gut flora, insulin resistance) and environmental factors (social and eating behaviours) that should be responsible of increased oxidative stress within hepatocytes. Even if we need non-invasive markers able to describe the progression of liver disease, only meaning of liver biopsy is useful to characterize the stigmata of worsening such as inflammation and fibrosis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1983  The accumulation of fat in hepatocytes with a necroinflammatory component-steatohepatitis-that may or may not have associated fibrosis is becoming a frequent lesion. Although steatohepatitis is currently recognized to be a leading cause of cryptogenic cirrhosis, the pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. Among the various factors implicated, intestinal bacterial overgrowth may play a role. Indeed, various rat models of intestinal bacterial overgrowth have been associated with liver lesions similar to NASH, and bacterial overgrowth has been observed significantly more often in patients with NASH compared with control subjects. The authors discuss the relationship among intestinal bacterial overgrowth, steatohepatitis development, and probiotic treatment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1984  Cytokines are mediators of cellular communication produced by multiple liver cell types. Cytokines can directly induce either necrosis or apoptosis. They can also recruit such cells as neutrophils and lymphocytes, which can mediate liver damage. Increased levels of hepatotoxic cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α are documented in alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and have been shown to play a mechanistic role in both of these disease processes. Transforming growth factor-β is a profibrotic cytokine that is critical in hepatic fibrosis. Beneficial cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-10 and -6, also exist. Such beneficial cytokines as adiponectin are made outside the liver and appear to protect against ALD and NASH. This article reviews the relevance of cytokines in human and experimental forms of liver injury, focusing on modulation of cytokines and the use of beneficial cytokines in treatment and prevention of liver injury in ALD, NASH, and hepatitis C.

       "1985  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), along with other forms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is an increasingly common clinico-pathological syndrome. It is frequently associated with obesity, especially visceral fat, and type 2 diabetes, and is intimately related to markers of the insulin resistance syndrome. Both the prevalence and the severity of liver steatosis are related to body mass index, waist circumference, hyperinsulinaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and impaired glucose tolerance. The pathophysiology of NASH involves two steps: 1) insulin resistance, which causes steatosis; 2) and oxidative stress, which produces lipid peroxidation and activates inflammatory cytokines. The identification of subjects who may progress from fatty liver to NASH, and from NASH to fibrosis/cirrhosis is an important clinical challenge as well as the finding of appropriate therapy that could prevent such deleterious process. Substantial weight loss is accompanied by a marked attenuation of insulin resistance and related metabolic syndrome and, concomitantly, by an important regression of liver steatosis in most patients, although mild inflammation may be detected in some subjects. Thus, NASH may be considered as another disease of affluence, as is the insulin resistance syndrome and perhaps being part of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "1986  Liver steatosis is a common human disease, most often caused by long-term alcohol consumption. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by similar histopathological features to those observed in alcoholic liver disease, but occurs in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Several aetiological factors contribute to NASH: obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidaemia, pregnancy, different chemical intoxications, parenteral nutrition, jejeuno-ileal bypass, chronic inflammatory bowel disease, nutritional protein deficiency and congenital metabolic disorders. Biochemically, oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation and their ensuing damage are implicated in the pathogenesis of NASH and alcoholic steatohepatitis (probably resulting from free fatty acids in the mitochondria, and induction of the cytochrome P450 isoform CYP2E1 in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cells). This paper deals with the pathomechanisms, clinical findings and currently available therapies for NASH. The potential use of metadoxine in the treatment of NASH is also discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1987  Cushing's syndrome (CS) due to ectopic ACTH secretion (EAS) has a high morbidity and mortality, because of the underlying tumor and the sequelae of severe hypercortisolemia. Therefore, rapid treatment of ectopic CS is mandatory. Scintigraphy shows that up to 80% of ectopic ACTH-producing tumors have somatostatin receptors. While this suggests that somatostatin analogs may reduce ACTH production and treat patients with EAS, the therapeutic role of these agents is still evolving. Here we demonstrate the spectrum of responses to octreotide therapy in 3 patients with EAS. Diagnostic imaging with the 111In-pentetreotide scan did not predict the therapeutic response to octreotide. Two patients with positive somatostatin receptor scintigraphy failed to respond to octreotide, while one with a negative scan reached eucortisolemia on a maintenance dose of 75 μg octreotide twice daily or octreotide LAP 30 mg per month. We conclude that octreotide is not a first line agent to control hypercortisolemia but may be a useful agent when other inhibitors of steroidogenesis fail or parenteral administration is required. Before therapy an octreotide challenge test may predict therapeutic response. Cortisol levels should be monitored regularly on somatostatin analog therapy, because of its unpredictable long-term pharmacodynamic profile. ©2003, Editrice Kurtis.Indications:3 patients with refractory Cushing's syndrome (CS) due to ectopic adrenocorticotrophin (ACTH) secretion (EAS).

       "1988  Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the term used for a common form of fatty liver presenting in adults with varied clinical manifestations. The most common presentation is asymptomatic elevation of liver enzymes (AST or SGOT and ALT or SGPT), which can be discovered incidentally in the course of an annual checkup, life insurance examination, or as part of surrogate screening before blood donation. At the other end of the clinical spectrum is the patient with complications from cryptogenic cirrhosis, who also shows a lack of evidence of alcohol as an etiological factor in pathogenesis. Clinical associations of probable relevance include gender (female), obesity, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia, but many patients do not conform to any of these stereotypes (e.g., young men of normal weight with normal fasting glucose and lipid levels). Liver biopsy confirms the diagnosis of NASH, the association of steatosis with an inflammatory response being the sine qua non for the condition and 'creeping fibrosis' being a variable but possibly sinister feature. Newer imaging techniques may provide convincing evidence of steatosis, but they give little insight into ongoing fibrosis, and liver biopsy therefore remains the gold standard. The mainstay of treatment remains judicious weight loss coupled with positive dietary advice, including the ingestion of adequate but not excessive vitamins. After initial encouraging data, the assessment of ursodeoxycholic acid currently being studied under randomized controlled conditions is eagerly awaited.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1989  Glycerol was shown recently to be metabolized to formaldehyde by microsomes from chowfed control rats (Winters et al., Biochem Biophys Res Commun 153: 612-617, 1988). In the present study, experiments were carried out to evaluate the oxidation of glycerol by microsomes isolated from rats treated with inducers of different isozymes of cytochrome P-450. The oxidation of glycerol to formaldehyde was increased in microsomes from rats treated with pyrazole, ethanol or acetone relative to their respective controls, but not after treatment with phenobarbital or 3-methylcholanthrene. This reaction was sensitive to inhibition by carbon monoxide and was inhibited by compounds known to be effective substrates for P-450j, e.g. aniline, ethanol, pyrazole and 4-methylpyrazole. Treatment with pyrazole caused an increase in Vmax for glycerol oxidation but did not affect the ifKitm (about 15 mM) for glycerol, as compared to saline controls. Evidence that the product of glycerol metabolism is formaldehyde was provided by the observation that this product served as a substrate for the glutathionedependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase, and the amount of formaldehyde detected was identical to that detected by the Nash reaction. By utilizing [14C]glycerol, and coupling the formaldehyde dehydrogenase reaction to the formate dehydrogenase reaction, 14CO2 could be detected, indicating that the formaldehyde produced was derived from the added glycerol. These results suggest that glycerol is not metabolically inert when added to microsomes but serves as an effective substrate for the cytochrome P-450j isozyme, extending the alcohol substrate specificity of this enzyme to poly-ols. The production of formaldehyde from glycerol may require caution since glycerol is often present in microsomal or reconstituted systems. © 1990.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1990  Background &amp; Aims There is evidence from clinical studies that compromised intestinal epithelial permeability contributes to the development of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), but the exact mechanisms are not clear. Mice with disruption of the gene (F11r) encoding junctional adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) have defects in intestinal epithelial permeability. We used these mice to study how disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier contributes to NASH. Methods Male C57BL/6 (control) or F11r-/- mice were fed a normal diet or a diet high in saturated fat, fructose, and cholesterol (HFCD) for 8 weeks. Liver and intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by histology, quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, and flow cytometry. Intestinal epithelial permeability was assessed in mice by measuring permeability to fluorescently labeled dextran. The intestinal microbiota were analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. We also analyzed biopsy specimens from proximal colons of 30 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and 19 subjects without NAFLD (controls) undergoing surveillance colonoscopy. Results F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD, but not a normal diet, developed histologic and pathologic features of severe NASH including steatosis, lobular inflammation, hepatocellular ballooning, and fibrosis, whereas control mice fed a HFCD developed only modest steatosis. Interestingly, there were no differences in body weight, ratio of liver weight:body weight, or glucose homeostasis between control and F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD. In these mice, liver injury was associated with significant increases in mucosal inflammation, tight junction disruption, and intestinal epithelial permeability to bacterial endotoxins, compared with control mice or F11r-/- mice fed a normal diet. The HFCD led to a significant increase in inflammatory microbial taxa in F11r-/- mice, compared with control mice. Administration of oral antibiotics or sequestration of bacterial endotoxins with sevelamer hydrochloride reduced mucosal inflammation and restored normal liver histology in F11r-/- mice fed a HFCD. Protein and transcript levels of JAM-A were significantly lower in the intestinal mucosa of patients with NAFLD than without NAFLD; decreased expression of JAM-A correlated with increased mucosal inflammation. Conclusions Mice with defects in intestinal epithelial permeability develop more severe steatohepatitis after a HFCD than control mice, and colon tissues from patients with NAFLD have lower levels of JAM-A and higher levels of inflammation than subjects without NAFLD. These findings indicate that intestinal epithelial barrier function and microbial dysbiosis contribute to the development of NASH. Restoration of intestinal barrier integrity and manipulation of gut microbiota might be developed as therapeutic strategies for patients with NASH. © 2016 AGA Institute                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "1991  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of liver disease from simple steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. NAFLD is commonly associated with features of the metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome (‘Metabolic/Obese NAFLD’) and may therefore predict type 2 diabetes (T2DM). For this review, we searched for prospective studies examining whether NAFLD predicts T2DM, and if so, whether this occurs independently of factors such as age and obesity. These studies included NAFLD diagnosed by ultrasonography (n = 6) or liver enzymes (n = 14). All ultrasonography studies found NAFLD to predict the risk of T2DM independently of age, and in 4 out of 6 studies NAFLD was also a predictor independently of BMI. NAFLD was a predictor of T2DM in all 14 studies where NAFLD was diagnosed by liver enzymes. In 12 of these studies, ALT or AST or GGT were significant predictors of T2DM risk, independently of age and BMI. NAFLD, however, is heterogeneous and may also be caused by common genetic variants. The I148M variant in PNPLA3 and the E167K variant in TM6SF2 are both associated with increased liver fat content, but not features of the metabolic/insulin resistance syndrome. These genetic forms of NAFLD predict NASH and cirrhosis but not T2DM. Taken together these data imply that ‘Metabolic/Obese NAFLD’ predicts T2DM independently of age and obesity and support the role of hepatic insulin resistance in the pathogenesis of this disease. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",
       "1992  Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum of disease ranging from simple steatosis (NAFL) to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis. “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” is closely associated with obesity and insulin resistance and therefore predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. NAFLD can also be caused by common genetic variants, the patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 (PNPLA3) or the transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2). Since NAFL, irrespective of its cause, can progress to NASH and liver fibrosis, its definition is of interest. We reviewed the literature to identify data on definition of normal liver fat using liver histology and different imaging tools, and analyzed whether NAFLD caused by the gene variants is associated with insulin resistance. Histologically, normal liver fat content in liver biopsies is most commonly defined as macroscopic steatosis in less than 5% of hepatocytes. In the population-based Dallas Heart Study, the upper 95th percentile of liver fat measured by proton magnetic spectroscopy (1H-MRS) in healthy subjects was 5.6%, which corresponds to approximately 15% histological liver fat. When measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based techniques such as the proton density fat fraction (PDFF), 5% macroscopic steatosis corresponds to a PDFF of 6% to 6.4%. In contrast to “Obese/metabolic NAFLD”, NAFLD caused by genetic variants is not associated with insulin resistance. This implies that NAFLD is heterogeneous and that “Obese/Metabolic NAFLD” but not NAFLD due to the PNPLA3 or TM6SF2 genetic variants predisposes to type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "1993  The growing epidemic of obesity, which causes nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and the more severe phenotype nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has paralleled the increasing incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Accumulating evidence demonstrates that overnutrition and metabolic pathways can trigger modifications of DNA and histones via deregulation of chromatin modifiers, resulting in aberrant transcriptional activity. However, the epigenetic regulation of HCC development in NAFLD remains obscure. Here, we uncover key epigenetic regulators using both dietary and genetic obesitypromoted HCC models through quantitative expression profiling and characterize the oncogenic activities of histone deacetylase HDAC8 in NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. HDAC8 is directly upregulated by the lipogenic transcription factor SREBP-1 where they are coexpressed in dietary obesity models of NASH and HCC. Lentiviral-mediated HDAC8 attenuation in vivo reversed insulin resistance and reduced NAFLD-associated tumorigenicity. HDAC8 modulation by genetic and pharmacologic approaches inhibited p53/p21-mediated apoptosis and G2-M phase cell-cycle arrest and stimulated β-catenin-dependent cell proliferation. Mechanistically, HDAC8 physically interacted with the chromatin modifier EZH2 to concordantly repress Wnt antagonists via histone H4 deacetylation and H3 lysine 27 trimethylation. In human NAFLD-associated HCC, levels of SREBP-1, HDAC8, EZH2, H4 deacetylation, H3K27me3, and active β-catenin were all correlated positively in tumors compared with nontumor tissues. Overall, our findings show how HDAC8 drives NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis, offering a novel epigenetic target to prevent or treat HCC in obese patients. © 2015 AACR.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1994  Key issues in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are the differentiation of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) from simple steatosis and staging of liver fibrosis, as patients with NASH/advanced fibrosis are at greatest risk of developing complications of end-stage liver disease. The controlled attenuation parameter is the most promising noninvasive technique for detecting and quantifying hepatic steatosis, but needs to be implemented with the XL probe and compared with ultrasound that, despite its limitations, remains the most widely used method. Cytokeratin-18 is currently the most extensively validated serum marker of NASH as a stand-alone test or as part of prediction models. However, it is not widely available and thus has not been introduced yet into practice. Transient elastography, as well as FIB-4 and NAFLD fibrosis scores are the best methods to rule out severe fibrosis and cirrhosis. However, the high rate of unreliable results with transient elastography remains a challenge, which is not completely addressed by the use of the XL probe. Given the high prevalence of NAFLD in the general population, these noninvasive methods could be used in clinical practice as first-line tools to screen patients with NAFLD to help determine those who may still require a liver biopsy. © 2015 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

We investigated its activity in patients with fatty liver.LAL activity (nmol/spot/h) was measured in 100 adult healthy subjects (HS) and in 240 NAFLD patients. A sub-analysis on 35 patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was performed.Median LAL activity was 1.15 (0.95-1.72) in HS. It was significantly reduced in NAFLD [0.78 (0.61-1.01), p < 0.001 vs. HS]. A further reduction was observed in the subgroup of NASH [0.67 (0.51-0.77), p < 0.001 vs HS]. Patients with LAL activity below median had higher values of serum total cholesterol (p <. 0.05) and LDL-c (p. <. 0.05), and increased serum liver enzymes (ALT, p < 0.001; AST, p < 0.01; GGT, p. <. 0.01). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with LAL activity below median were ALT (OR: 1.018, 95% CI 1.004-1.032, p = 0.011) and metabolic syndrome (OR: 2.551, 95% CI 1.241-5.245, p = 0.011), whilst statin use predicted a better LAL function (OR: 0.464, 95% CI 0.248-0.866, p. =. 0.016).Our findings suggest a strong association between impaired LAL activity and NAFLD. A better knowledge of the role of LAL may provide new insights in NAFLD pathogenesis. © 2015 The Authors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1996  Objective No therapy for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) has been approved so far. Roux-en-y gastric bypass (RYGB) is emerging as a therapeutic option, although its effect on NASH and related hepatic molecular pathways is unclear from human studies. We studied the effect of RYGB on pre-existent NASH and hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction-a key player in NASH pathogenesis -in a novel diet-induced mouse model nicely mimicking human disease. Design C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat highsucrose diet (HF-HSD). Results HF-HSD led to early obesity, insulin resistance and hypercholesterolaemia. HF-HSD consistently induced NASH (steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning and inflammation) with fibrosis already after 12-week feeding. NASH was accompanied by hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction, characterised by decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complex I and IV activity, ATP depletion, ultrastructural abnormalities, together with higher 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE) levels, increased uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) and tumour necrosis factor- α (TNF-α) mRNA and free cholesterol accumulation. In our model of NASH and acquired mitochondrial dysfunction, RYGB induced sustained weight loss, improved insulin resistance and inhibited progression of NASH, with a marked reversal of fibrosis. In parallel, RYGB preserved hepatic MRC complex I activity, restored ATP levels, limited HNE production and decreased TNF-α mRNA. Conclusions Progression of NASH and NASH-related hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction can be prevented by RYGB. RYGB preserves respiratory chain complex activity, thereby restoring energy output, probably by limiting the amount of oxidative stress and TNF-α. These data suggest that modulation of hepatic mitochondrial function contributes to the favourable effect of RYBG on established NASH.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1997  Morphine is metabolized in humans to morphine-3-glucuronide (M3G) and the pharmacologically active morphine-6-glucuronide (M6G). The hepatobiliary disposition of both metabolites relies upon multidrug resistance-associated proteins Mrp3 and Mrp2, located on the sinusoidal and canalicularmembrane, respectively. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), the severe stage of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, alters xenobiotic metabolizing enzyme and transporter function. The purpose of this study was to determine whether NASH contributes to the large interindividual variability and postoperative adverse events associated with morphine therapy. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a control diet or a methionine- and choline-deficient diet to induce NASH. Radiolabeled morphine (2.5 mg/kg, 30 μCi/kg) was administered intravenously, and plasma and bile (0-150 or 0-240 minutes), liver and kidney, and cumulative urine were analyzed formorphine and M3G. The antinociceptive response to M6G (5 mg/kg) was assessed (0-12 hours) after direct intraperitoneal administration since rats do not produce M6G. NASH caused a net decrease in morphine concentrations in the bile and plasma and a net increase in theM3G/morphine plasma area under the concentration-time curve ratio, consistent with upregulation of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase Ugt2b1. Despite increased systemic exposure to M3G, NASH resulted in decreased biliary excretion and hepatic accumulation of M3G. This shift toward systemic retention is consistent with the mislocalization of canalicular Mrp2 and increased expression of sinusoidalMrp3 in NASH andmay correlate to increased antinociception by M6G. Increased metabolism and altered transporter regulation in NASH provide a mechanistic basis for interindividual variability in morphine disposition that may lead to opioid-related toxicity.

       "1998  Background & Aims Sustained c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation by saturated fatty acids plays a role in lipotoxicity and the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). We have reported that the interaction of JNK with mitochondrial Sab leads to inhibition of respiration, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), cell death and hepatotoxicity. We tested whether this pathway underlies palmitic acid (PA)-induced lipotoxicity in hepatocytes. Methods Primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH) from adeno-shlacZ or adeno-shSab treated mice and HuH7 cells were used. Results In PMH, PA dose-dependently up to 1 mM stimulated oxygen consumption rate (OCR) due to mitochondrial β-oxidation. At â>4;1.5 mM, PA gradually reduced OCR, followed by cell death. Inhibition of JNK, caspases or treatment with antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) protected PMH against cell death. Sab knockdown or a membrane permeable Sab blocking peptide prevented PA-induced mitochondrial impairment, but inhibited only the late phase of both JNK activation (beyond 4 h) and cell death. In PMH, PA increased p-PERK and its downstream target CHOP, but failed to activate the IRE-1α arm of the UPR. However, Sab silencing did not affect PA-induced PERK activation. Conversely, specific inhibition of PERK prevented JNK activation and cell death, indicating a major role upstream of JNK activation. Conclusions The effect of p-JNK on mitochondria plays a key role in PA-mediated lipotoxicity. The interplay of p-JNK with mitochondrial Sab leads to impaired respiration, ROS production, sustained JNK activation, and apoptosis. © 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
