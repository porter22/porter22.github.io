      "Message": "I strongly recommend increasing the priority of this issue; I downloaded xml explorer, opened a document that happened to be using a namespace, and tried several xpath queries, only to find that even the simplest query failed to produce results.  I simply assumed xpath was entirely broken, and was ready to uninstall your application and start looking for an alternative until I found this bug report.\r\n\r\nI'd imagine that I'm far from the first to encounter this problem.",

The Namespaces tab pane allows you to customize the prefix used.  XPath expressions to select these elements must include this prefix.\r\n\r\nThere are no plans to fix this issue in version 2.",
