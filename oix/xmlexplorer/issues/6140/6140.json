    "Description": "entering a closing square bracket when XPath-Query-TextBox is focussed has not the desired effect.\nExample: I want to select all books with Attribute ID='Test' with the following xpath-query:\n//Book[@BookId='Test']\nI can not enter the last character of the line by pressing the corresponding key (German QWERTZ-layout) - although the query works fine when entered via clipboard.\nObviously some keypress-event is canceled or the key is reserved for some special function.",
