The current view is not much better than notepad in my opinion. For example when I open an XML that has nodes with many attributes they extend way over off the screen\r\n causing me to have to scroll back and forth.</p>\r\n<p>Honestly I think XML notepad has a great way to visualize the XML, it would be great if XML explorer added the ability to view the XML in a tree view type fashion like XML notepad has.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Thanks!</p>\r\n<p>Keep up the good work!</p>\r\n",
