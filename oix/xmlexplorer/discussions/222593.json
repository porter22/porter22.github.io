If your document specifies a schema (using xsi:schemaLocation or xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation), it will automatically be validated, and any errors will show up in the Errors pane.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the latest source I've added a 'hack' to manually add schemas.  Just double-click the no schema warning (&quot;The document does not have a schema specified&quot;), and you can browse to one or more XSD schema files.  I will make this a more fully-featured part of the app and include it in a future build the next chance I get.",
