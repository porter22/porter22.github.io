Should be easier and lighter to use from other projects now (no dependency on docking library).\n\nChanges in 4.0.1:\n\n* Added settings pane, allows changing user settings, some of which take effect immediately (UseSyntaxHighlighting, Font, ForeColor).\n* Fixed an excpetion and a slight but annoying delay during startup, both related to automatic update checking.\n* Added XPath selection Up and Down buttons, providing the ability to select beyond the first XPath match. Enter key selects the first match, then repeated Enter key presses selects the next match. Added label next to buttons to show current location within results, like '1 of 50'.\n\nChanges in 4.0.2:\n* Added an 'Open URL' button and File menu item, will download and open XML files from a user-specified URL. Added handling of certificate errors and basic HTTP authentication.\n* Added additional methods to XPathNavigatorTreeView to enable better integration into 3rd party applications.",

    "Name": "XML Explorer 4.0.5",
    "DevelopmentStatus": "Beta",
    "Description": "Changes in 4.0.5:\n\n* Added 'Copy Attribute XPath to Address Bar' feature.\n* Added methods for decoding node text and value from Base64 encoded strings, and copying them to the clipboard.\n* Added 'ChildNodeDefinitions' to the options, which allows for easier navigation of parent-child and ID-IDREF relationships. Discovery happens on-demand, as nodes are expanded and child nodes are added.  Nodes can now have 'virtual' child nodes, defined by an xpath to select an identifier (usually relative to the current node like @id), and another xpath to find matching virtual child nodes using that identifier, like //*[@parentId='{0}']. Standard String.Format syntax is used.\n* Improved the expressions pane with a proper toolbar with buttons to launch, edit, delete, and filter expressions.\n* Changed expressions pane behavior, selection no longer executes expressions, only activation (double-click or enter to select, hold shift to launch new tab).\n* Improved performance of syntax highlighting.\n* Fixed some issues with xpath expressions not updating the toolbar buttons and xpath textbox.\n* Fixed the XML Schema link on the Errors pane.\n* Added a ShowNodeToolTips, which sets the property of the same name on the TreeView control, which changes the way tooltips are shown on nodes. It does not hide tooltips entirely (like the name suggests) but only changes tooltips to show directly over a node, or to the lower-left of the cursor, like normal tooltips.\n* Disabled the 'end tag' nodes that were being added on expansion, and removed on collapse. This decreases the amount of 'flicker' when expanding and collapsing nodes. I'll eventually add another option for this.\n* Added an ExceptionDialog, instead of showing exceptions in a MessageBox. Allows for easy copying of exception and stack trace text.\n* Fixed an exception when trying to copy or drag a text node.\n* Fixed formatting issues when copying node XML.\n\nChanges in 4.0.2:\n\n* Added an 'Open URL' button and File menu item, will download and open XML files from a user-specified URL. Added handling of certificate errors and basic HTTP authentication.\n* Added additional methods to XPathNavigatorTreeView to enable better integration into 3rd party applications.\n\nChanges in 4.0.1:\n\n* Added settings pane, allows changing user settings, some of which take effect immediately (UseSyntaxHighlighting, Font, ForeColor).\n* Fixed an excpetion and a slight but annoying delay during startup, both related to automatic update checking.\n* Added XPath selection Up and Down buttons, providing the ability to select beyond the first XPath match. Enter key selects the first match, then repeated Enter key presses selects the next match. Added label next to buttons to show current location within results, like '1 of 50'.\n\nChanges in 4.0:\n\n* This release is built on the Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile.\n* Changed XSD validation to use the schema specified by the XML documents.\n* Added a VS style Error List, double-clicking an error takes you to the offending node.\n** XPathNavigator schema validation finally gives SourceObject (was fixed in .NET 4).\n* Added Namespaces window and better support for XPath expressions in documents with a default namespace.\n* Added ExpandAll and CollapseAll toolbar buttons (in addition to the already present main menu and context menu items).\n* Added a prompt on first run (per user) to choose default file types (Vista, Win7 and newer).\n* Setup now registers XML Explorer with Windows as a recommended program for opening .xml, .xsd, .config, .xsl files (Open With).\n* Refactored the XPathNavigatorTreeView and its dependencies to a separate project. Should be easier and lighter to use from other projects now (no dependency on docking library).",
